Background: Immune mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) commonly affect young and adolescent females. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNE)-alpha agents are increasingly used to treat these conditions, but their safety during pregnancy remains unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the risk of pregnancy related outcomes in patients with various immune mediated diseases treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for studies assessing the outcome of pregnancy in female patients with various immune mediated diseases who were treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents. Direct and network meta-analyses were performed between anti-TNF-alpha users, non-users, and the general population. Results: Thirteen studies (including RA, IBD and various immune mediated diseases) were identified. Among the studies that compared the outcome between anti-TNF-alpha users and the general population, anti-TNF-alpha users had a non-significant trend towards reduced rate of live birth (odds ratio (OR) = 0.38 (P = 0.081), 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.13 L13) and were at significantly increased risk of preterm birth (OR = 2.62 (P < 0.0001), 95% CI = 2.12-3.23), spontaneous abortion (OR = 4.08 (P = 0.033), 95% CI = 1.12-14.89) and low birth weight (OR = 5.95 (P = 0.032), 95% CI = 1.17-30.38) compared to the general population. Risk of anomalies was not elevated (OR = 1.46 (P = 0.18), 95% CI = 0.84-2.56). Among the studies that compared the outcome between anti-TNF-alpha users and non-users, there were no significant differences in the rates of live birth and pregnancy related complications. Among the studies that compared the outcome between non-anti-TNF-alpha users and the general population, risk of spontaneous abortion was elevated (OR = 2.60 (P = 0.033), 95% CI = 1.08-6.27), but there were no significant differences in the rates of live birth and other pregnancy related complications. Network meta-analysis confirmed the rank order of all outcomes as general population, non-users and users of anti-TNF-alpha agents (ascending order based on safety). Conclusions: Female patients with immune mediated diseases treated with anti-TNF-alpha agents were at significantly increased risks of preterm birth, spontaneous abortion and low birth weight compared to the general population, but had comparable outcomes with non-users. These results provide useful information for female patients in their reproductive age and raise awareness of the conditions that they are facing among clinicians managing their care.

When we conserve energy resources from any systems, our environment can enjoy cleaner air and a healthier, and we can help protect the climate by reducing heating due to more energy consumption. Energy Efficient medical equipment design is the latest research in medical science. Now, scientists are focus and shifting toward energy efficient medical system design. ECG machine is the most commonly used in medical equipments. If any equipment consuming less power than the environment, climate and whole medical regions will be move to greener, pollution-less and energy efficient. Finally, it reduces the cost of medical treatment and save energy consumptions. In this work, we are going to design and implement energy efficient ECG machine using LVDCI (Low Voltage Digitally Control Impedance), SSTL (Stub Series Terminated Logic) and HSTL (High Speed Transistor Logic) I/O standard.
Women are still underrepresented in management and men hold the majority of higher positions. Nonetheless, one often-heard claim in popular media is that female people-centered leadership skills (empathy, communication, etc.) are a better match for the business world - especially in the future. Furthermore, a related idea is that women may use this advantage to take over men's dominant position in leadership. Four studies show that such claims paradoxically maintain gender inequality, by undermining support for affirmative action to reduce female underrepresentation in leadership. Where earlier research shows that positive stereotypes can hurt women by suggesting that they are unqualified for leadership, the current findings show that even positive stereotypes that claim that women are particularly well qualified for leadership can hurt women in their chances for gaining leadership positions. Although it is good to highlight the advantages of female leadership, exaggerated and sensationalist claims contribute to a perpetuation of gender inequality.
Vaccine development against extracellular bacteria has been important for the sustainability of the aquaculture industry. In contrast, infections with intracellular pathogens remain largely an unresolved problem. Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium that causes the disease francisellosis in fish. Francisellosis is commonly characterized as a chronic granulomatous disease with high morbidity and can result in high mortality depending on the host. In this study, we explored the potential of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) as a vaccine agent against F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis. Bacterial MVs are spherical structures naturally released from the membrane of bacteria and are often enriched with selected bacterial components such as toxins and signaling molecules. MVs were isolated from broth-cultured F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis in the present work, and proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that MVs contained a variety of immunogenic factors, including the intracellular growth proteins lgIC and lgIB, known to be part of a Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI), as well as outer membrane protein OmpA, chaperonin GroEL, and chaperone ClpB. By using flow cytometry and electron microscopy, we observed that F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis mainly infects myelomonocytic cells, both in vivo and in vitro. Immunization with MVs isolated from F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis protects zebrafish from subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis. To determine if MVs induce a typical acute inflammatory response, mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of tnfa, il1b, and ifng, as well as mhcii, mpeg1.1, and ighm, was upregulated, thus confirming the immunogenic properties of F. noatunensis subsp. orientalis-derived MVs.
The demand for additive processes that provide components with high technological performance became overriding regardless of the application area. For medical applications, the orthopedics field-multimaterial orthoses and splint-scan clearly benefit from direct additive manufacturing using a hybrid process instead of the traditional handmade manufacturing, which is slow, expensive, inaccurate, and difficult to reproduce. The ability to provide faster better orthoses, using innovative services and technologies, resulting in lower recovery times, reduced symptoms, and improved functional capacity, result in a significant impact on quality of life and the well-being of citizens. With these purposes, this work presents an integrate methodology, that includes the tridimensional (3D) scanning, 3D computer-aided design modeling, and the direct digital manufacturing of multimaterial orthoses and splints. Nevertheless, additive manufacturing of components with functional gradients, multimaterial components, e.g. metal/plastic is a great challenge since the processing factors for each one of them are very different. This paper proposes the addition of two advanced additive manufacturing technologies, the selective laser melting and the stereolithography, enabling the production of a photopolymerization of the polymer in the voids of a 3D metal mesh previously produced by selective laser melting. Based on biomimetic structures concept, this mesh is subject to a previous design optimization procedure in order to optimize its geometry, minimizing the mass involved and evidencing increased mechanical strength among other characteristics. A prototype of a hybrid additive manufacturing device was developed and its flexibility of construction, geometrical freedom, and different materials processability is demonstrated through the case study-arm orthosis-presented in this work.
Background: Neurodegenerative disorders, such as deficits in learning, memory and cognition and Alzheimer's disease are associated with diabetes mellitus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor and is known to possess anti-obesity, anti-diabetic actions and is believed to have a role in memory and Alzheimer's disease. Objective: To investigate whether STZ can reduce BDNF production by rat insulinoma (RIN5F) cells in vitro and decrease BDNF levels in the pancreas, liver and brain in vivo. Methods: Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cytotoxicity to RIN5F cells in vitro and type 2 DM in Wistar rats was employed in the present study. Cell viability, activities of various anti-oxidants and secretion of BDNF by RIN5F cells in vitro were measured using MIT assay, biochemical methods and ELISA respectively. In STZ-induced type 2 DM rats: plasma glucose, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels and BDNF protein expression in the pancreas, liver and brain tissues were measured. In addition, neuronal count and morphology in the hippocampus and hypothalamus areas was assessed. Results: STZ-induced suppression of RIN5F cell viability was abrogated by BDNF. STZ suppressed BDNF secretion by RIN5F cells in vitro. STZ-induced type 2 DM rats showed hyperglycemia, enhanced plasma IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels and reduced plasma and pancreas, liver and brain tissues (P < 0.001) and increased oxidative stress compared to untreated control. Hypothalamic and hippocampal neuron in STZ-treated animals showed a decrease in the number of neurons and morphological changes suggesting of STZ cytotoxicity. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that STZ is not only cytotoxic to pancreatic beta cells but also to hypothalamic and hippocampal neurons by inducing oxidative stress. STZ ability to suppress BDNF production by pancreas, liver and brain tissues suggests that impaired memory, learning, and cognitive dysfunction seen in diabetes mellitus could be due to BDNF deficiency.

With the advancement of power electronics, new materials and novel bearing technologies, there has been an active development of high speed machines in recent years. The simple rotor structure makes switched reluctance machines (SRM) candidates for high speed operation. This paper has presents the design of a low power, 50,000 RPM 6/4 SRM having a toroidally wound stator. Finite element analysis (FEA) shows an equivalence to conventionally wound SRMs in terms of torque capability. With the conventional asymmetric converter and classic angular control, this toroidal-winding SRM (TSRM) is able to produce 233.20 W mechanical power with an efficiency of 75% at the FEA stage. Considering the enhanced cooling capability as the winding is directly exposed to air, the toroidal winding is a good option for high-speed SRM.
The present research compared the validity of popular direct and indirect measures of self-esteem in predicting self-confident behaviour in different social situations. In line with behavioural dual-process models, both implicit and explicit self-esteem were hypothesized to be related to appearing self-confident to unacquainted others. A total of 127 participants responded to the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Scale, and an adjective scale for measuring explicit self-esteem (ESE). Participants' implicit self-esteem (ISE) was assessed with four indirect measures: the Implicit Association Test (IAT), the name-letter task (NLT), and two variants of an affective priming task, the reaction-time affective priming task (RT-APT) and the error-based affective priming task (EB-APT). Self-confident behaviour was observed in four different social situations: (i) self-introduction to a group; (ii) an ostracism experience; (iii) an interview about the ostracism experience; and (iv) an interview about one's personal life. In general, appearing self-confident to unknown others was independently predicted by ESE and ISE. The indirect measures of self-esteem were, as expected, not correlated, and only the self-esteem APTs-but not the self-esteem IAT or the NLT-predicted self-confident behaviours. It is important to note that in particular the predictive power of the self-esteem EB-APT pertained to all four criteria and was incremental to the ESE measures.

Massive public pressure is arising to achieve data privacy and protection. One way to maintain data privacy is to perform efficient data disposal processes. This minimizes the chances of data leakage over an extended period and through irresponsible actions. That is why adequate data disposal is essential in so many governmental and critical institutions. Simply deleting data does not erase it. In fact, it only removes the name that refers to that piece of data, but the data itself remains. In this paper, we utilize an encryption algorithm and then perform a randomization process to dispose of data values in an irreversible approach making it difficult to retrieve the original value of data from the defaced result.
Here we provide evidence that repeated immobilization stress (RIS) in rats induces a persistent increase in noradrenergic activity in the anterior aspects of the anterolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aIBNST). This increase in noradrenergic activity results from both enhanced synthesis and reuptake of norepinephrine (NE). It leads to a decrease in the synaptic availability of NE, which elicits an augmented noradrenergic response to the inhibitors of NE reuptake (NRIs), such as desipramine (DMI), an antidepressant. The enduring depression-like behavior and the augmentation of the climbing behavior seen in repeatedly stressed rats following subchronic administration of DMI in the forced swimming test (FST) might be explained by a dysregulation of noradrenergic transmission observed in alBNST. Taken together, we propose that dysregulation of noradrenergic transmission such as the one described in the present work may represent a mechanism underlying major depressive disorders (MDD) with melancholic features in humans.

The periaqueductal gray (PAG) has been commonly recognized as a downstream site in neural networks for the expression of a variety of behaviors and is thought to provide stereotyped responses. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the PAG may exert more complex modulation of a number of behavioral responses and work as a unique hub supplying primal emotional tone to influence prosencephalic sites mediating complex aversive and appetitive responses. Of particular relevance, we review how the PAG is involved in influencing complex forms of defensive responses, such as circa-strike and risk assessment responses in animals. In addition, we discuss putative dorsal PAG ascending paths that are likely to convey information related to threatening events to cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuits involved in the processing of fear learning. Finally, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of the PAG in reward seeking and note that the lateral PAG is part of the circuitry related to goal-oriented responses mediating the motivation to hunt and perhaps drug seeking behavior.

Computer systems are designed to help solve problems presented to our society. New terms such as computational sustainability and internet of things present new fields where traditional information systems are being applied and implemented on the environment to maximize data output and our ability to understand how to improve them. The advancement of richer and interconnected devices has created opportunities to gather new data sources from the environment and use it together with other pre-existent information in new reasoning processes. This work describes a sensorial platform designed to help raise awareness towards sustainability and energy efficient systems by exploring the concepts of ambient intelligence and fusion of data to create monitoring and assessment systems. The presented platform embodies the effort to raise awareness of user actions on their impact towards their sustainability objectives.
Water crisis is one of the supreme challenges worldwide as clean water is the ultimate need for human civilization and all other life on earth. In the present study, continuous adsorption experiments were carried out in an adsorption column to survey the efficiency of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for removal of pollutants from water/wastewater in terms of physicochemical parameters, such as electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC), by using both single-walled carbon nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Sample solutions were allowed to flow in down-flow mode through the fixed-bed of CNTs. The CNTs column showed a reduction efficiency of electrical conductivity 80 % from effluent treatment plant (ETP) treated water sample, 69.23 % from raw effluent sample, and 53.33 % from the synthetic salt water sample. Similarly, the efficiency of TDS reduction was 78.61 % from raw effluent sample, 66.86 % from ETP treated water sample, and 62.02 % from the synthetic salt water sample. COD also reduced 84.71 % from raw effluent sample and 39.58 % from the ETP treated water sample. In case of TOC, the column showed a reduction efficiency of 85.88 % from the ETP treated water sample and 70.79 % from the raw effluent sample. These findings suggested that CNTs present a great potential in removal of pollutants in terms of physicochemical parameters from water/wastewater.
Non-verbal expressions of pride convey status. But pride displays can be interpreted as either authentic or hubristic. Given negative stereotypes about Blacks, we hypothesized that when displaying pride, Blacks would be rated higher in hubristic and lower in authentic pride compared to Whites. Contrary to predictions, three experiments found consistent evidence that Whites are judged to be more hubristic than Blacks when displaying pride. This effect occurred when pride was displayed in an unspecified (Study 1), academic (Study 2), or work-related context (Study 3). Effects were largely specific to pride displays and not a function of a general race-based response bias. We speculate that these counterintuitive findings might reflect a negative reaction to those with high status flaunting their success.
The elongation of styles and stigma (silks) of maize (Zea mays) flowers is rapid (1-3mmh(-1)), occurs over a short period and plays a pivotal role in reproductive success in adverse environments. Silk elongation rate was measured using displacement transducers in 350 plants of eight genotypes during eight experiments with varying evaporative demand and soil water status. Measured time courses revealed that silk elongation rate closely followed changes in soil water status and evaporative demand, with day-night alternations similar to those in leaves. Day-night alternations were steeper with high than with low plant transpiration rate, manipulated via evaporative demand or by covering part of the leaf area. Half times of changes in silk elongation rate upon changes in evaporative demand or soil water status were 10-30min, similar to those in leaves. The sensitivity of silk elongation rate to xylem water potential was genetically linked to that of leaf elongation rate. Lines greatly differed for these sensitivities. These results are consistent with a common hydraulic control of expansive growth in vegetative and reproductive structures upon changes in environmental conditions via a close connection with the xylem water potential. They have important implications for breeding, modelling and phenotyping.
Background: The field of structural dynamics of cytoskeletons in living cells is gathering wide interest, since better understanding of cytoskeleton intracellular organization will provide us with not only insights into basic cell biology but may also enable development of new strategies in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy, fields in which cytoskeleton-dependent dynamics play a pivotal role. The nanoneedle technology is a powerful tool allowing for intracellular investigations, as it can be directly inserted into live cells by penetrating through the plasma membrane causing minimal damage to cells, under the precise manipulation using atomic force microscope. Modifications of the nanoneedles using antibodies have allowed for accurate mechanical detection of various cytoskeletal components, including actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments. However, successful penetration of the nanoneedle through the plasma membrane has been shown to vary greatly between different cell types and conditions. In an effort to overcome this problem and improve the success rate of nanoneedle insertion into the live cells, we have focused here on the fluidity of the membrane lipid bilayer, which may hinder nanoneedle penetration into the cytosolic environment. Results: We aimed to reduce apparent fluidity of the membrane by either increasing the approach velocity or reducing experimental temperatures. Although changes in approach velocity did not have much effect, lowering the temperature was found to greatly improve the detection of unbinding forces, suggesting that alteration in the plasma membrane fluidity led to increase in nanoneedle penetration. Conclusions: Operation at a lower temperature of 4 degrees C greatly improved the success rate of nanoneedle insertion to live cells at an optimized approach velocity, while it did not affect the binding of antibodies immobilized on the nanoneedle to vimentins for mechanical detection. As these experimental parameters can be applied to various cell types, these results may improve the versatility of the nanoneedle technology to other cell lines and platforms.
Background: Maternal supplementation with long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can have immunologic effects on the developing fetus through several anti-inflammatory pathways. However, there is limited knowledge of the long-term programming effects. Objective: In a randomized controlled trial from 1990 with 24 years of follow-up, our aim was to determine whether supplementation with 2.7 g of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in pregnancy can reduce the risk of asthma in offspring and allergic respiratory disease. Methods: The randomized controlled trial included 533 women who were randomly assigned to receive fish oil during the third trimester of pregnancy, olive oil, or no oil in the ratio 2: 1: 1. The offspring were followed in a mandatory national prescription register, with complete follow-up for prescriptions related to the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis as primary outcomes. Furthermore, the offspring were invited to complete a questionnaire (74% participated) and attend a clinical examination (47% participated) at age 18 to 19 years. Results: In intention-to-treat analyses the probability of having had asthma medication prescribed was significantly reduced in the fish oil group compared with the olive oil group (hazard ratio, 0.54, 95% CI, 0.32-0.90; P = .02). The probability of having had allergic rhinitis medication prescribed was also reduced in the fish oil group compared with the olive oil group (hazard ratio, 0.70, 95% CI, 0.47-1.05; P = .09), but the difference was not statistically significant. Self-reported information collected at age 18 to 19 years supported these findings. No associations were detected with respect to lung function outcomes or allergic sensitization at 18 to 19 years of age. Conclusion: Maternal supplementation with fish oil might have prophylactic potential for long-term prevention of asthma in offspring.
A 6/8 flux-switching machine with large air-gap and toroidal winding design is presented. The fractional-slot winding of C-core flux-switching machine is wound around the stator yoke instead of the stator pole in this machine design. On the basis of the C-core flux-switching machine several modifications of the stator core shape and of PM arrangement are evaluated by means of 2D Finite Element Analysis. A significant enhancement of the torque capability of the toroidal winding design can be achieved by some minor changes of the stator core shape. Additionally, the application of Halbach shaped magnets leads to even more torque and a reduction of the leakage flux at the stator outer diameter.
This study examined the impact of a selective anxiety prevention program for offspring of clinically anxious parents on three domains of child functioning: (1) social, (2) familial, and (3) emotional/behavioral. Dyads were randomized into either the Coping and Promoting Strength program (CAPS; n = 70) or Information Monitoring (IM; n = 66) comparison group. Multi-informant assessments were conducted at baseline, post intervention, and 6 and 12 months follow-ups. Random effects mixed models under the linear growth modeling (LGM) framework was used to assess the impact of CAPS on growth trajectories. Over time, children in the CAPS group had significantly lower anxiety, anxious/depressed symptoms, and lower total behavior problems (parent report), compared to children in IM group. The intervention did not impact other domains assessed (e.g., social functioning), which may be due to floor effects on these measures. Longitudinal follow-up data is needed to provide valuable information about this high risk population.
Eosinophils constitute an important component of helminth immunity and are not only associated with various allergies but are also linked to autoinflammatory disorders, including the skin disease psoriasis. Here we demonstrate the functional relationship between eosinophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as related to skin diseases. We previously showed that pDCs colocalize with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in psoriatic skin. Here we demonstrate that eosinophils are found in psoriatic skin near neutrophils and NETs, suggesting that pDC responses can be regulated by eosinophils. Eosinophils inhibited pDC function in vitro through a mechanism that did not involve cell contact but depended on soluble factors. In pDCs stimulated by specific NET components, eosinophil-conditioned media attenuated the production of interferon a (IFN alpha) but did not affect the maturation of pDCs as evidenced by the unaltered expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. As pDCs and IFN alpha play a key role in autoimmune skin inflammation, these data suggest that eosinophils may influence autoinflammatory responses through their impact on the production of IFN alpha a by pDCs.
This paper describes the use of simulation in supporting system design and in improving manufacturing performance at the Ford powertrain operations, Manufacturing Engineering division. Simulation modelling of engine assembly lines is carried out using the Ford Assembly Simulation Tool (FAST) which is an Excel based front-end user interface to the Witness simulation system. FAST is a component-based Simulation system that enables engineers and non-simulation experts to develop engine assembly models easily and quickly. The model building is also enhanced by the use of specialised sub-models (Witness modules). Assembly line models are automatically built using a Witness shell that imports data from Excel data sheets, produces Witness elements and populates the elements with relevant data. The importance of the quality of input data and their sources has been emphasised. The models are generally verified using expected cyclic throughput values, and validated with real manufacturing data from the shop floor. Validated models are used to assess and enhance performances of engine assembly lines.
Smart people detection systems are nowadays using heterogeneous cameras. This paper proposes an architecture which is focused on robustly detecting people by infrared and visible video fusion in smart environment. The architecture covers all levels provided by the INT-Horus framework, initially designed to perform monitoring and activity interpretation tasks. Indeed, INT-Horus is used as the development environment where the approach starts with image segmentation in both infrared and visible spectra. Then, the results are fused to enhance the overall detection performance. The paper describes in detail the INT-Horus levels selected to implement the new architecture. These are the acquisition, segmentation, fusion, identification and Tracking levels.
Purpose: This was a retrospective cohort study designed to evaluate the clinical performance of ceramicveneered zirconia frameworks. Materials and Methods: Patients were recruited according to defined inclusion criteria. All patients were checked every 4 months from the time of definitive rehabilitation. At the end of 2013, all patients were rescheduled and rechecked for study purposes. The restorative procedures assessment was performed by previously established methods. The primary outcomes were the survival and success rates of the prosthesis. Descriptive statistics were used for the patient's demographics, implant distribution, and occurrence of complications. To study the survival and success of the prostheses, a Cox Regression analysis was used with a model constructed in a forward conditional stepwise mode. Predictive variables were included in the model, and adjusted survival curves were obtained for each outcome. Results: From 2008 to 2013, 75 patients were rehabilitated with 92 implant-supported, screw-retained, full-arch ceramic-veneered zirconia framework rehabilitations. The range of follow-up was between 6 months and 5 years. From the 92 full implant-supported screw-retained full-arch rehabilitations, Cox regression analysis indicated that within a 5-year time frame, the probability of framework fracture, major chipping, minor chipping, or any of the former combined to occur was 17.6%, 46.5%, 69.2%, and 90.5%, respectively. Conclusion: Results suggest zirconia as a suitable material for framework structure in implant-supported, full-arch rehabilitations. However, it experiences a high incidence of technical complications, mainly due to ceramic chipping. Further clinical studies should aim to ascertain the effects of clinical features and manufacturing procedures on the survival rates of these prostheses.
Object oriented modeling (OOM) has become an integral part of the design process in construction due to advances in computer software. Despite these advances there remains a tendency for Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) to be used as the medium to assist in the creation, modification, analysis and optimization of Electrical and Instrumentation (E&I) systems within heavy industrial engineering projects. In this paper, a retrospective OOM (i.e., Systems Information Model (SIM)), for the E&I systems of a utility facility, which was constructed for an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor for the purpose of undertaking a construct ability assessment prior to the commencement of construction is presented and discussed. The CAD drawings and cable schedule produced by the EPC were provided to an E&I organization to undertake a constructability assessment; errors, omissions and information redundancy were identified and quantified. The SIM model was then used to examine a tender proposal from a construction subcontractor (CS) of the EPC; discrepancies were identified and it is suggested that differences arose due to the prevailing errors and omissions. The potential use of a SIM during construction as a quality assurance/control (QA/QC) is then examined, as it is suggested that it can be used to ensure the development of an 'As-built' model and provide a realistic representation of the constructed asset, which safeguards its integrity for operations and maintenance.

Biofilms are ubiquitous in the pipes of drinking water distribution systems (DWDSs), and recent experimental studies revealed that the chlorination of the microbial carbon associated with the biofilm contributes to the total disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation with distinct mechanisms from those formed from precursors derived from natural organic matter (NOM). A multiple species reactive transport model was developed to explain the role of biofilms in DBPs formation by accounting for the simultaneous transport and interactions of disinfectants, organic compounds, and biomass. Using parameter values from experimental studies in the literature, the model equations were solved to predict chlorine decay and microbial regrowth dynamics in an actual DWDS, and trihalomethanes (THMs) formation in a pilot-scale distribution system simulator. The model's capability of reproducing the measured concentrations of free chlorine, suspended biomass, and THMs under different hydrodynamic and temperature conditions was demonstrated. The contribution of bacteria-derived precursors to the total THMs production was found to have a significant dependence on the system's hydraulics, seasonal variables, and the quality of the treated drinking water. Under system conditions that promoted fast bacterial re-growth, the transformation of non-microbial into microbial carbon DBP precursors by the biofilms showed a noticeable effect on the kinetics of THMs formation, especially when a high initial chlorine dose was applied. These conditions included elevated water temperature and high concentrations of nutrients in the influent water. The fraction of THMs formed from microbial sources was found to reach a peak of 12% of the total produced THMs under the investigated scenarios. The results demonstrated the importance of integrating bacterial regrowth dynamics in predictive DBPs formation models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
In addition to buffering plants from water stress during severe droughts, plant water storage (PWS) alters many features of the spatio-temporal dynamics of water movement in the soil-plant system. How PWS impacts water dynamics and drought resilience is explored using a multi-layer porous media model. The model numerically resolves soil-plant hydrodynamics by coupling them to leaf-level gas exchange and soil-root interfacial layers. Novel features of the model are the considerations of a coordinated relationship between stomatal aperture variation and whole-system hydraulics and of the effects of PWS and nocturnal transpiration (Fe,night) on hydraulic redistribution (HR) in the soil. The model results suggest that daytime PWS usage and Fe,night generate a residual water potential gradient (p,night) along the plant vascular system overnight. This p,night represents a non-negligible competing sink strength that diminishes the significance of HR. Considering the co-occurrence of PWS usage and HR during a single extended dry-down, a wide range of plant attributes and environmental/soil conditions selected to enhance or suppress plant drought resilience is discussed. When compared with HR, model calculations suggest that increased root water influx into plant conducting-tissues overnight maintains a more favorable water status at the leaf, thereby delaying the onset of drought stress.
Two assumptions guide the current research. First, people's desire to see themselves as moral disposes them to make attributions that enhance or protect their moral self-image: When approached with a prosocial request, people are inclined to attribute their own noncompliance to external factors, while attributing their own compliance to internal factors. Second, these attributions can backfire when put to a material test. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that people who attribute their refusal of a prosocial request to an external factor (e.g., having an appointment), but then have that excuse removed, are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior than those who were never given an excuse to begin with. Study 3 shows that people view it as more morally reprehensible to no longer honor the acceptance of a prosocial request if an accompanying external incentive is removed than to refuse a request unaccompanied by an external incentive. Study 4 extends this finding and suggests that people who attribute the derision to behave prosocially to an internal factor despite the presence of an external incentive are more likely to continue to behave prosocially once the external incentive is removed than are those for whom no external incentive was ever offered. This research contributes to an understanding of the dynamics underlying the perpetuation of moral self-regard and suggests interventions to increase prosocial behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Over several years, the trend of e-learning study has spread to all levels of education. The benefits of this trend are undeniable. When studying using e-learning materials students are connected to the internet and therefore they are able to trace quickly and easily additional information that are not given in the text or are is not explained adequately. It has a positive impact on students and their development of independence, creativity and in some cases is possible that the student does not even notice she/he is educating herself/him. Of course, this method has disadvantages such as e.g. health problems from frequent sitting at the computer, problems with social skills and communication, etc. Despite this, the method of teaching is certainly indispensable to the future and certainly it will replace the existing system partly or even completely. Unfortunately, the implementation of this trend is not so simple and faces many obstacles at all levels of education. In theoretical fields such as philosophy and human sciences, the creation of e-learning materials is easier. Lecture notes that are taught in the form of very long texts written on the blackboard or in the form of dictation during lectures are redesigned into electronic form and are supplemented by simple interactive elements that are used to test the students during studies. In technical fields such as machine design, the automotive industry, metallurgy, machining, etc. we face problems when in the course of teaching we must combine theoretical information, practical principles and industrial practices. But merging theory and practice creates a big problem when developing electronic interactive study materials which should be identical to the feelings that students will gain on a real example. Therefore our Department of Machine Design at the University of West Bohemia focused on this problem and conducted research of software tools that can be used to create educational materials. We sought inspiration not only online, but also from colleagues at other universities and in industry. The paper describes some of these tools and processes, including their advantages and disadvantages and it should be used as inspiration for other colleagues that are also focusing on this problem.
PurposeEpidemiological studies of asthma in adolescence commonly rely on self-reports. This study aimed to compare adolescent and parent reports regarding the presence of asthma and asthma symptoms in two ethnic groups, Jews and Arabs, living in the same country. MethodsEighth-grade pupils attending five schools in Tel Aviv and four schools in two Arab cities in Israel were asked to complete the self-report International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire in the classroom. Their parents were interviewed by telephone using the parental ISAAC questionnaire. We assessed prevalence rates of asthma and asthma symptoms according to adolescent and parent responses. Agreement between adolescents and parents was assessed by Cohen's kappa coefficient. ResultsAdolescents reported more asthma and asthma symptoms than their parents in both the Jewish (327 adolescent-parent pairs) and the Arab (335 adolescent-parent pairs) groups. Both groups showed moderate adolescent-parent chance-corrected agreement for current asthma (kappa 0.59 in Jews, 0.52 in Arabs, P=0.60) and lifetime asthma (kappa 0.53 Jews, 0.44 in Arabs, P=0.33); and slight to fair chance-corrected agreement for asthma symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences between the Jewish and Arab populations in chance-corrected agreement for any of the parameters assessed. ConclusionsJewish and Arab adolescents more often report asthma and asthma symptoms than do their parents. This seems to be a cross-cultural phenomenon. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the source of information when comparing prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms across studies. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:154-159.

Conveyor systems allow quick and efficient transportation for a wide variety of materials, which make them very popular in the material handling and packaging industries. Many kinds of conveying systems are available and used according to the various needs of different industries. Adjustable speed drives are used for the operation of the conveyors used in a number of industries. We can use adjustable electric drives in a number of industrial applications. A typical adjustable speed drive consists of an induction motor and a power electronic converter. In most cases, motor speed is commanded so that the control system requires an actual speed signal for closing the speed loop. In industrial applications, speed sensors, as well as sensorless solutions, are used. Due to the possibility of current speed sensor noises and for maintenance and economic aspects, the trend is to substitute speed sensors by computational solutions. Comprehensive reviews of the sensorless drives show that there are still some persistent problems associated with the sensorless control, that needs new solutions. In ASDs, the advanced control approach of IM is the FOC method, used in modern industrial drives. The current stator controller is the integral part of various FOC systems. In the classical FOC solution, PI or hysteresis controllers are generally used. However, PCCs are reported to have better properties. System sensitivity to inaccuracy and changes of motor equivalent circuit parameters are another problem in electrical drives. Almost all of the FOC systems are very sensitive to such inaccuracies; therefore, some parameters should be estimated online, and a robust structure of the control is required. The real-time implementation of the system is an important task even for electric drives or power converters.
In this paper, the development of a polarimetric phased array weather radar, which consists of a dual-polarized antenna with 2-D circular planar phase-array elements, is discussed. The radar is capable of measuring the 3-D rainfall distribution in less than several tens of seconds. Digital beam-forming (DBF) is an important component in the development process of the phased array radar. In this paper, precipitation radar signal simulations are performed taking into consideration radar concepts in order to discuss the estimation accuracy of polarimetric precipitation profiles (differential reflectivity, specific differential phase, and copolar correlation coefficient) with two DBF methods that are based on Fourier and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) methods. A comparison of the performance of the two methods indicates that MMSE is superior in accuracy because of the effect of a stable and a robust main lobe and adaptively suppressed side lobes. MMSE also provides precipitation measurements eliminating the directional dependence of a beam pattern for improving the accuracy of measurements. It is also shown that the estimated accuracies of the precipitation profiles are almost independent of the number of pulses.
A number of security protocols have been designed for mobile transactions using Near Field Communication technology in the last few years. However, the component architectures of these protocols are rarely implemented in Java for further evaluation. In this paper, we briefly discuss our previously proposed mobile transaction authentication protocol and extend our work by presenting its Java implementation. This implementation provides a detailed analysis based on a number of factors with respect to the security considerations of the protocol, particularly in its design stage. Thus, it provides a broad verification as well as step-by-step evaluation of the protocol specifications from its implementation point of view.
The advantages of minimum-phase (MP) systems for control applications are well known. Prior research has shown that a non-MP (NMP) system can be discretized to an MP system using either a zero-order hold (ZOH) or a square-pulse sample-and-hold input (SHI). This paper investigates the MP characteristics of the discrete-time (DT) system obtained by discretizing a continuous-time single-input single-output NMP system using different SHIs. Two new SHIs (forward and backward triangular) are studied in addition to the square pulse. Numerical simulations were adopted for studying the MP property of the resulting DT system as a function of sample-and-hold parameters. The simulation results show that it is possible to find a smaller sampling period that results in an MP DT system using the proposed SHIs compared with the ZOH. The q-Markov cover system identification with pseudorandom binary signal was then used for a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation study. A resistor-capacitor filter was used to represent the implementation error of the SHI due to unmodeled actuator dynamics. The HIL simulation results show that the proposed SHI scheme is robust to actuator modeling error. The MP properties of the DT systems with three SHIs are compared. The results show that the forward triangle SHI has the best performance due to its robustness to unmodeled actuator dynamics and the capability of retaining the MP property of the discretized system at small sampling periods.
Under homeostatic conditions, as well as in various diseases, leukocyte migration is a crucial issue for the immune system that is mainly organized through the activation of bone marrow-derived cells in various tissues. Immune cell trafficking is orchestrated by a family of small proteins called chemokines. Leukocytes express cell-surface receptors that bind to chemokines and trigger transendothelial migration. Most allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinitis, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis, are generally classified by the tissue rather than the type of inflammation, making the chemokine/chemokine receptor system a key point of the immune response. Moreover, because small antagonists can easily block such receptors, various molecules have been developed to suppress the recruitment of immune cells during allergic reactions, representing potential new drugs for allergies. We review the chemokines and chemokine receptors that are important in asthma, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis and their respectively developed antagonists.
Radical right political parties are usually heavily male-dominated; accordingly, previous research has concentrated on the perspective of men. The present study aims to enhance the understanding of the worldview of women within radical right parties. Taking a critical discursive psychological approach, the study looks at how female populist radical right politicians in Sweden and Finland discursively negotiate the tension between the Nordic societal norm of gender equality, on the one hand, and the patriarchal ideology of populist radical right parties, on the other. The analysis suggests that the female populist radical right politicians' discourse is indeed highly ambivalent. The discursive tension between gender equality and a patriarchal politics is heavily intertwined with two further tensions: first, that of a societal norm against prejudice versus a politics based on xenophobia; and second, that of a culture that cherishes individualism versus a political pressure to homogenize the political or cultural Other'. The study compares the discourse of female populist radical right politicians in the two country contexts. Moreover, it discusses the differences and similarities between this discourse, on the one hand, and that of male populist radical right politicians, on the other. Finally, it analyses the gendered and racialized categorizations accomplished by the discursive patterns, and elaborates on their societal implications.
Objective: To propose a phylogenetic significance to the Moro reflex which remains unexplained since its publication in 1918 because both hands are free at the end of the gesture. Method: Among the 75 videos of healthy term newborns we have filmed in a research project on antenatal education to parenthood, we describe a sequence that clearly showed the successive movements of the Moro reflex and we report the occurrence of this reflex in the videos that were recorded from Time 0 of birth defined as the moment that lies between the birth of the thorax and the pelvis of the infant. Results: The selected sequence showed the following succession of the newborn's actions: quick extension-adduction of both arms, the orientation of the body, head and eyes towards a human person, and full extension-abduction of both arms with spreading of the fingers, crying and a distressed face. There were 13 Moro reflexes between 2 and 14s from Time 0 of birth. We found a significant association between the occurrence of the Moro reflex and the placement of the newborn at birth in supine position on the mother's abdomen (p = 0.002). Discussion: The quick extension-adduction of both arms which started the sequence may be considered as a startle reflex controlled by the neural fear system and the arm extension adduction which followed as a Moro reflex. The characteristics of all Moro reflexes were those of ritualization: amplitude, duration, stereotype of the gestures. This evolutionary process turns a physiological behavior, grasping in this case, to a non-verbal communicative behavior whose meaning is a request to be picked up in the arms. The gestures associated with the Moro reflex: crying and orientation of the body, head, and eyes towards a human person, are gestures of intention to communicate which support our hypothesis. The neural mechanism of the Moro reaction probably involves both the fear and the separation-distress systems. Conclusion: This paper proposes for the first time a phylogenetic significance to the Moro reflex: a ritualized behavior of nonverbal communication. Professionals should avoid stimulating the newborns' fear system by unnecessarily triggering Moro reflexes. Antenatal education should teach parents to respond to the Moro reflexes of their newborn infant by picking her up in their arms with mother talk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
We described the phylogenetic affiliation, development in cultures and ultrastructural features of a trypanosome of Leptodacylus chaquensis from the Pantanal biome of Brazil. In the inferred phylogeny, this trypanosome nested into the Anura clade of the basal Aquatic clade of Trypanosoma, but was separate from all known species within this clade. This finding enabled us to describe it as Trypanosoma herthameyeri n. sp., which also infects other Leptodacylus species from the Pantanal and Caatinga biomes. Trypanosoma herthameyeri multiplies as small rounded forms clumped together and evolving into multiple-fission forms and rosettes of epimastigotes released as long forms with long flagella; scarce trypomastigotes and glove-like forms are common in stationary-phase cultures. For the first time, a trypanosome from an amphibian was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, revealing a cytostome opening, well-developed flagellar lamella, and many grooves in pumpkin-like forms. Transmission electron microscopy showed highly developed Golgi complexes, relaxed catenation of KDNA, and a rich set of spongiome tubules in a regular parallel arrangement to the flagellar pocket as confirmed by electron tomography. Considering the basal position in the phylogenetic tree, developmental and ultrastructural data of T. herthameyeri are valuable for evolutionary studies of trypanosome architecture and cell biology.
Background: Despite global efforts, HIV-related stigma continues to negatively impact the health and well-being of people living with HIV/AIDS. Even in healthcare settings, people with HIV/AIDS experience discrimination. Anecdotal evidence suggests that healthcare professionals in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, a lower-middle income country situated in Southeast Asia, stigmatize HIV/AID patients. The purpose of this study was to assess HIV stigmatizing attitudes within Laotian healthcare service providers and examine some of the factors associated with HIV/AIDS-related stigma among doctors and nurses. Methods: A structured questionnaire, which included a HIV-related stigma scale consisting of 17 items, was self-completed by 558 healthcare workers from 12 of the 17 hospitals in Vientiane. Five hospitals were excluded because they had less than 10 staff and these staff were not always present. The questionnaire was pre-tested with 40 healthcare workers. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and comparisons between groups undertaken using chi-square test and t-test. Bivariate and multiple linear regression analyses were carried out to examine the associations between stigmatizing attitudes and independent variables. Results: Out of the 558 participating healthcare workers, 277 (49.7%) were doctors and 281 (50.3%) were nurses. Nearly 50% of doctors and nurses included in the study had high levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Across the different health professionals included in this study, lower levels of HIV/AIDS knowledge were associated with higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Stigmatizing attitudes, including discrimination at work, fear of AIDS, and prejudice, were lower in healthcare workers with more experience in treating HIV/AIDS patients. Conclusions: This study is the first to report on HIV/AIDS-related stigmatization among healthcare workers in Lao PDR. Stigmatizing attitudes contribute to missed opportunities for prevention, education and treatment, undermining efforts to manage and prevent HIV. Reversing stigmatizing attitudes and practices requires interventions that address affective, cognitive and behavioral aspects of stigma. Alongside this, health professionals need to be enabled to enact universal precautions and prevent occupational transmission of HIV.
Online social networking sites (SNSs) have gained increasing popularity in the last decade, with individuals engaging in SNSs to connect with others who share similar interests. The perceived need to be online may result in compulsive use of SNSs, which in extreme cases may result in symptoms and consequences traditionally associated with substance-related addictions. In order to present new insights into online social networking and addiction, in this paper, 10 lessons learned concerning online social networking sites and addiction based on the insights derived from recent empirical research will be presented. These are: (i) social networking and social media use are not the same; (ii) social networking is eclectic; (iii) social networking is a way of being; (iv) individuals can become addicted to using social networking sites; (v) Facebook addiction is only one example of SNS addiction; (vi) fear of missing out (FOMO) may be part of SNS addiction; (vii) smartphone addiction may be part of SNS addiction; (viii) nomophobia may be part of SNS addiction; (ix) there are sociodemographic differences in SNS addiction; and (x) there are methodological problems with research to date. These are discussed in turn. Recommendations for research and clinical applications are provided.
As an important regulator of pollutants in overland flow and interflow, land use has become an essential research component for determining the relationships between surface water quality and pollution sources. This study investigated the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to identify the impact of land use and population density on surface water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China. A manual variable excluding-selecting method was explored to resolve multicollinearity issues. Standard regression coefficient analysis coupled with cluster analysis was introduced to determine which variable had the greatest influence on water quality. Results showed that: (1) Impact of land use on water quality varied with spatial and seasonal scales. Both positive and negative effects for certain land-use indicators were found in different subcatchments. (2) Urban land was the dominant factor influencing N, P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in highly urbanized regions, but the relationship was weak as the pollutants were mainly from point sources. Agricultural land was the primary factor influencing N and P in suburban and rural areas; the relationship was strong as the pollutants were mainly from agricultural surface runoff. Subcatchments located in suburban areas were identified with urban land as the primary influencing factor during the wet season while agricultural land was identified as a more prevalent influencing factor during the dry season. (3) Adjusted R-2 values in OLS models using the manual variable excluding-selecting method averaged 14.3% higher than using stepwise multiple linear regressions. However, the corresponding GWR models had adjusted R-2 similar to 59.2% higher than the optimal OLS models, confirming that GWR models demonstrated better prediction accuracy. Based on our findings, water resource protection policies should consider site-specific land-use conditions within each watershed to optimize mitigation strategies for contrasting land-use characteristics and seasonal variations.

Geocell is an effective type of geosynthetics for improving the performance of reinforced soil foundations due to provision of lateral confinement for the infill soil. In this research, in order to study the bearing pressure-settlement response of geocell-reinforced sand, a reduced-scale physical model is developed and geocells with various geometrical dimensions (height, pocket size, and width) produced from woven geotextile are used to reinforce sand bed. Strip footing model is then loaded monotonically to ultimate failure level, and the influence of geocell geometrical properties on the improvement in bearing capacity and settlement of footing is described. The results show that by increasing height and decreasing pocket size of geocell, the beneficial effect of geocell reinforcement increases substantially. For the highest geocell used in the tests at settlement level of 6%, improvement in bearing capacity and percentage reduction in footing settlement are obtained as 2.1 and 48%, respectively. The optimum width of geocell is determined five times the foundation width beyond which the improvement effect is negligible. It is also concluded that substituting a single layer of geocell reinforcement with 2 half -height and 4 quarter-height geocell layers results in 10% and 22% decrease in the ultimate bearing capacity, respectively.

CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in graft-specific tolerance after solid organ transplantation. However, adoptive transfer of polyspecific Tregs alone is insufficient to prevent graft rejection even in rodent models, indicating that graft-specific Tregs are required. We developed a highly specific chimeric antigen receptor that recognizes the HLA molecule A*02 (referred to as A2-CAR). Transduction into natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) changes the specificity of the nTregs without alteration of their regulatory phenotype and epigenetic stability. Activation of nTregs via the A2-CAR induced proliferation and enhanced the suppressor function of modified nTregs. Compared with nTregs, A2-CAR Tregs exhibited superior control of strong allospecific immune responses in vitro and in humanized mouse models. A2-CAR Tregs completely prevented rejection of allogeneic target cells and tissues in immune reconstituted humanized mice in the absence of any immunosuppression. Therefore, these modified cells have great potential for incorporation into clinical trials of Treg-supported weaning after allogeneic transplantation.
The practice of rainwater harvesting (RWH) is spreading rapidly in urban areas. This article studies the impact of a possible generalization of this practice for municipalities by proposing a new method to quantify the potential for potable water savings (PPWS) by using rainwater harvesting at the urban level. The proposed method is based on the adaptation of an already validated model assessing the PPWS for single buildings and the use of urban databases. Two concepts are introduced: (1) the building type that allows gathering all the buildings sharing common features; and (2) the equivalent building, which is used to assess the PPWS of a set of buildings (of a same building type) as if it were a single building. In the case of the municipality of Colombes (located in the suburbs of Paris), the method shows that the PPWS by using rainwater harvesting represents about 10% of the total potable water consumption: the residential buildings account for 64% of this potential. This method can be applied to other municipalities with a level of acceptable reliability with regard to the means to be implemented in terms of collecting information.
The economic and environmental benefits brought by electric vehicles (EVs) cannot be fully delivered unless these vehicles are fully or partially charged by renewable energy sources (RES) such as photovoltaic system (PVS). Nevertheless, the EV charging management problem of a parking station integrated with RES is challenging due to the uncertain nature of local RES generation. This paper aims to address these difficulties by deploying an energy storage system (ESS) in parking stations and exploiting the charging and discharging scheduling of EVs to achieve better utilization of intermittent PVS for EV charging. A real-time charging optimization scheme is also formulated, using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to coordinate the charging or discharging power of EVs along with the power dispatches of power grid and ESS based on the vehicles' charging or discharging priorities and electricity price preferences. Extensive simulations show that the proposed approach not only maximizes the satisfaction of EV owners in terms of fulfilling all charging and discharging requests, but also minimizes the overall operational cost of the parking station by prioritizing the utilization of energy from PVS, ESS, and scheduling of every EV's charging and discharging.
Controlling groundwater is always of great concern for tunnel management. A tunnel drainage system may not function properly due to insufficient drain capacity, or because drains become clogged with sediment such as calcium carbonate. In this study, various types of geocomposites were investigated in a laboratory to evaluate their filtration and discharge capacity characteristics for their potential use in tunnels. The drain capacity of the geocomposites was then compared with that of a needle-punched non-woven geotextile, currently used as a drain layer material in tunnels. Based on the results of discharge capacity tests performed on four types of geocomposites found to meet the filtration requirements, the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in water was found to result in a decrease of approximately 30% of maximum discharge capacity under a confining pressure of 100 kPa. Also, the maximum reduction observed in the discharge capacity was approximately 65% as the confining pressure increased from 50 to 400 kPa. The comparison between the geocomposites and the non-woven needle-punched geotextiles, however, revealed that the geocomposites have a significantly larger discharge capacity than that of non-woven needle-punched geotextiles with similar thickness (i.e., an approximate average of 25 times larger). Moreover, the discharge capacity of the geocomposites is relatively less affected by CaCO3 and confining pressure compared with the non-woven needle-punched geotextile. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is to monitor activities to detect breaches in security policies of a computer system or a network. This paper focuses on anomaly detection paradigm of IDS. The goal of anomaly-based IDS is to classify intrusion based on system and network activities outside of a normal region. In this paper we employ a multiple-detector set artificial immune system, a variation of artificial immune system, to classify intrusion based on features of application layer protocols (e.g., http, ftp, smtp, etc.) in network data flows. Our result shows the multiple-detector set artificial immune system achieved a Detection Rate of 53.34% and a False Positive Rate of 0.20%. The mAIS achieved an accuracy of 76.57%.
Burullus Lake is the second largest lake along the Mediterranean Sea and represents one of the most subjected lakes to pollution at the delta's coastline. The present study explores the use of Landsat data and GIS for assessing water pollution at Burullus Lake, Egypt. Multi- spectral Landsat- 8 OLI image dated 2015 provided the necessary information to this study. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to the image. Land use/cover map was obtained to identify natural resources and types of human activities in the area surrounding the Lake. Three previously developed water quality empirical models for BOD, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were applied on the calibrated image. Then, a GIS model was generated to identify areas recording high levels of BOD, TN and TP. Results confirmed that the Lake water is subjected to pollution from multiple sources; particularly domestic and agricultural drains. Shallow water (i. e. Lake Shores), where human activities are influencing, reported high levels of water studied pollutants. The model indicated that south western and north eastern parts of the Lake are the most polluted parts, recording relatively high levels of BOD, TN and TP; >4.46 mg L-1, >18.33 mg L-1 and >15.59 mg L-1, respectively. Results were ascertained based on water quality investigations in relevant research studies on the Lake. It was concluded that Burullus Lake is extensively subjected to interrupting human activities which have a great negative impact on water quality. Also dataobservation techniques and water quality empirical models were successful in assessing and mapping water pollution. (C) 2016 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are caused by the accumulation of the abnormal prion protein scrapie (PrPSc). Prion protein aggregation, misfolding, and cytotoxicity in the brain are the major causes of neuronal dysfunction and ultimate neurodegeneration in all TSEs. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been studied extensively in all major protein misfolding aggregating diseases, especially Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, but the role of parkin in TSEs remains unknown. Here we investigated the role of parkin in a prion disease cell model in which neuroblastoma2a (N2a) cells were treated with prion peptide PrP106-126. We observed a gradual decrease in the soluble parkin level upon treatment with PrP106-126 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, endogenous parkin colocalized with FITC-tagged prion fragment106-126. Overexpression of parkin in N2a cells via transfection repressed apoptosis by enhancing autophagy. Parkin-overexpressing cells also showed reductions in apoptotic BAX translocation to the mitochondria and cytochrome c release to the cytosol, which ultimately inhibited activation of proapoptotic caspases. Taken together, our findings reveal a parkin-mediated cytoprotective mechanism against PrP106-126 toxicity, which is a novel potential therapeutic target for treating prion diseases.
Given two linear projections of maximal rank from P-k to P-h1 and P-h2 with k >= 3 and h(1) + h(2) >= k+1 the Grassmann tensor introduced by Hartley and Schaffalitzky (Int J Comput Vis 83(3):274-293, 2009. doi:10.1007/s11263-009-0225-1), turns out to be a generalized fundamental matrix. Such matrices are studied in detail and, in particular, their rank is computed. The dimension of the variety that parameterizes such matrices is also determined. An algorithmic application of the generalized fundamental matrix to projective reconstruction is described.
The potential impacts of climate change on the food security of subsistence farmers is a serious concern. This article explores the food security situations of two categories of subsistence farm households, vegetable- and cereal-based farming systems, in the Makwanpur district of Nepal in the context of climate change. Local climate data for the past 30 years were analyzed. Interviews with local farmers and key informants, and focus group discussions were carried out to collect the primary data. Empirical data showed that changes in climate variables for the study period were in line with farmers' perceptions and that farming communities were negatively impacted. Perceived impacts were erratic rainfall, increased frequency of floods and droughts, soil degradation and insect pests, weeds and diseases. Farmers have modified traditional cropping patterns and calendar, changed crop varieties and increased fertilizer and pesticide applications in order to maintain crop yields. They have also sought off-farm employment. However, agricultural productivity in the area is declining and only one third of all households in the area were food secure. Household food insecurity was at mild to moderate levels, but vegetable-based households were more secure than cereal-based ones. At the household level, locally successful adaptive measures, such as rainwater harvesting, mulching, planting date adjustments, off-farm opportunities, including infrastructure and extension support, could increase production and contribute to reversing the impact of increased risk attributed to climate change.
Recent research (e.g., Hutter, Crisp, Humphreys, Waters, & Moffit; Siebler) has confirmed that combining novel social categories involves two stages (e.g., Hampton; Hastie, Schroeder, & Weber). Furthermore, it is also evident that following stage 1 (constituent additivity), the second stage in these models involves cognitively effortful complex reasoning. However, while current theory and research has addressed how category conjunctions are initially represented to some degree, it is not clear precisely where we first combine or bind existing social constituent categories. For example, how and where do we compose and temporarily store a coherent representation of an individual who shares membership of female and blacksmith categories? In this article, we consider how the revised multi-component model of working memory (Baddeley) can assist in resolving the representational limitations in the extant two-stage theoretical models. This is a new approach to understanding how novel conjunctions form new bound composite representations.
In this paper, we propose a computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework for the simulations of the interaction between free-surface flow and floating structures, such as offshore wind turbines. The framework is based on a suitable combination of the finite element method (FEM) and isogeometric analysis (IGA), and has good efficiency, accuracy and robustness characteristics. The free-surface phenomena are modeled using the Navier-Stokes equations of incompressible two-fluid flow in conjunction with the level set method. The FEM-based moving-domain ALE-VMS technique is employed to discretize the fluid mechanics equations, while the IGA-based rotation-free shell and beam/cable formulation is employed to model the mechanics of floating structures. The kinematic and traction compatibility at the fluid structure interface is handled by means of a recently-developed augmented Lagrangian FSI formulation with formal elimination of the Lagrange multiplier variable. A quasi-direct coupling strategy is adopted to handle the large added mass, and implemented by means of a matrix-free technique. The mathematical formulation of the FSI problem and its algorithmic implementation are described in detail, and two numerical test cases are presented. The first case is a free-surface-flow benchmark example of a solitary wave impacting a fixed, rigid platform. The second case is a set of full-scale free-surface-FSI simulations of the OC3-Hywind floating wind turbine design subjected to wave action. The computational results are compared with experimental and simulation data, with good agreement achieved in all cases where such data was available. Wind-turbine computations in the regime of high-amplitude waves are also presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
The present article reviews the biotechnological research in Zingiber montanum (Koenig) Link ex A. Dietr. (cassumunar ginger). Studies on biotechnological interventions in this plant were focused mainly on the application of tissue culture techniques. Recently, attentions are being drawn towards the genomic studies which mostly aimed at establishing the genetic relationship of different gene pools. The present review summarizes the various aspects of tissue culture protocol for in vitro micropropagation, in vitro microrhizome induction, in vitro conservation technology and molecular biology studies of this medicinal plant. This review will help in further research of this plant in areas related to tissue culture for propagation and increased production of important secondary metabolites, phylogenetic analysis and genetic engineering. Moreover, it will offer an insight into crop improvement and breeding programs of this important underutilized medicinal plant for improved yield and quality of secondary metabolites.
Much attention has been paid to burden shifting of CO2 emissions from developed regions to developing regions through trade. However, less discussed is that trade also acts as a mechanism enabling wealthy consumers to shift water quantity and quality stress to their trading partners. In this study, we investigate how Shanghai, the largest megacity in China, draws water resources from all over China and outsources its pollution through virtual quantity and quality water flows associated with trade. The results show that Shanghai's consumption of goods and services in 2007 led to 11.6 billion m(3) of freshwater consumption, 796 thousand tons of COD, and 16.2 thousand tons of NH3-N in discharged wastewater. Of this, 79% of freshwater consumption, 82.9% of COD and 82.5% of NH3-N occurred in other Chinese Provinces which provide goods and services to Shanghai. Thirteen Provinces with severe and extreme water quantity stress accounted for 60% of net virtual water import to Shanghai, while 19 Provinces experiencing water quality stress endured 79% of net COD outsourcing and 75.5% of net NH3-N outsourcing from Shanghai. In accordance with the three redlines recently put forward by the Chinese central government to control water pollution and cap total water use in all provinces, we suggest that Shanghai should share its responsibility for reducing water quantity and quality stress in its trading partners through taking measures at provincial, industrial, and consumer levels. In the meantime, Shanghai needs to enhance demand side management by promoting low water intensity consumption.
The current study examined associations between mothers' behavioral profiles during mother-child conflict interactions and their children's social skills. This person-centered approach classified 181 mothers according to their levels of emotional responsiveness, intrusiveness, negativity, and engagement facilitation behaviors during an eight-minute conflict discussion task with their child. Three distinct classes of mothers were identified using latent profile analysis: sensitive/engaged, moderately sensitive/engaged, and insensitive/disengaged. An analysis of covariance indicated that children of mothers in the sensitive/engaged group had significantly higher social skills than children of mothers in the moderately sensitive/engaged and insensitive/disengaged groups. Results suggest that mother-child conflict interactions may benefit children's social development when mothers facilitate their children's participation in a highly sensitive manner.
This pilot study investigated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an Internet Support Group (ISG) for parents of children with NF1. Eligible parents were recruited by email and completed baseline questionnaires assessing social support, self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety. The ISG involved eight weekly 90-min chat sessions and a discussion forum open 24 h/day for 8 weeks. Follow-up measures were completed immediately post-intervention and 3 months later. Parents from 33 families (29 mothers, 4 fathers) completed baseline measures. Over half of parents (52 %) rated their child's disease severity as mild, 33 % moderate, and 15 % severe. Among 21 parents who completed post-intervention measures, ratings of perceived emotional (p = .0008) and informational (p = .0003) support increased. There were no significant changes in self-efficacy, depression, or anxiety (ps >.05). The mean satisfaction rating was moderately high (7.6/10; range 4-10). Some parents commented that the chat sessions were at inconvenient times, which may have limited participation. Preliminary evidence in this small sample of parents suggests that ISGs may be a feasible and potentially efficacious method of providing support to parents of children with NF1. Having multiple weekly chat sessions held at various days and times may improve accessibility and participation. Clinicians are encouraged to help parents access online support resources.
Neurons are highly differentiated cells responsible for the conduction and transmission of information in the nervous system. The proper function of a neuron relies on the compartmentalization of their intracellular domains. Differentiated neuroblastoma cells have been extensively used to study and understand the physiology and cell biology of neuronal cells. Here, we show that differentiation of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells is more pronounced upon exposure of a chemical analog of cyclic AMP (cAMP), db-cAMP. We next analysed the expression of key microtubule-regulating proteins in differentiated cells and the expression and activation of key cAMP players such as EPAC, PKA and AKAP79/150. Most of the microtubule-promoting factors were up regulated during differentiation of N1E-115 cells, while microtubule-destabilizing proteins were down regulated. We observed an increase in tubulin post-translational modifications related to microtubule stability. As expected, db-cAMP increased PKA- and EPAC-dependent signalling. Consistently, pharmacological modulation of EPAC activity instructed cell differentiation, number of neurites, and neurite length in N1E-115 cells. Moreover, disruption of the PKA-AKAP interaction reduced these morphometric parameters. Interestingly, PKA and EPAC act synergistically to induce neuronal differentiation in N1E-115. Altogether these results show that the changes observed in the differentiation of N1E-115 cells proceed by regulating several microtubule-stabilizing factors, and the acquisition of a neuronal phenotype is a process involving concerted although independent functions of EPAC and PKA.
Words activate cortical regions in accordance with their modality of presentation (i.e., written vs. spoken), yet there is a long-standing debate about whether patterns of activity in any specific brain region capture modality invariant conceptual information. Deficits in patients with semantic dementia highlight the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) as an amodal store of semantic knowledge but these studies do not permit precise localisation of this function. The current investigation used multiple imaging methods in healthy participants to examine functional dissociations within ATL. Multi-voxel pattern analysis identified spatially segregated regions: a response to input modality in anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) and a response to meaning in more ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). This functional dissociation was supported by resting-state connectivity that found greater coupling for aSTG with primary auditory cortex and vATL with the default mode network. A meta-analytic decoding of these connectivity patterns implicated aSTG in processes closely tied to auditory processing (such as phonology and language) and vATL in meaning-based tasks (such as comprehension or social cognition). Thus we provide converging evidence for the segregation of meaning and input modality in the ATL.
Negotiation convergence is a crucial part of the automated multi-issue negotiation process. To improve the negotiation convergence process and to minimize complexity an agenda based approach can be used to build a new negotiation model. The agenda based model investigates the significance of the choice of the sequence in issue-by-issue negotiation. This model can improve an agent's utility by providing efficient convergence and an effective equilibrium outcome. The main motivation is to construct a new model which is symmetric and Pareto-optimal. The proposed automated negotiation approach deals with the multiple issues in such a way that it helps to balance the efficiency and effectiveness of the outcome. The model is analysed in an ambient intelligence domain in order to prove its effectiveness.
This paper discusses the implementation of a burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model within the Reactor Dynamics and Fuel Modeling Group (RDFMG) version of the subchannel thermal-hydraulics code COBRA-TF (CTF). The model takes into account the degradation of fuel thermal conductivity at high burnups and its dependence on the Gadolinium content for both UO2 (uranium dioxide) and MOX (mixed oxide) nuclear fuel rods. The modified Nuclear Fuel Industries (NFI) model for UO2 rods and the Duriez/Modified NFI model for MOX rods were incorporated in CTF. To validate the models, the fuel centerline temperatures predicted with CTF were compared to Halden reactor experimental data and to high fidelity FRAPCON-3.4 calculations. Halden test cases for UO2 fuel rods at the beginning of life (BOL), through lifetime with and without Gd2O3; and for MOX fuel rods were simulated with CTF. It was demonstrated that CTF with the new burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model predicts the fuel centerline temperature with less than a 5% error as compared to the Halden measurements. CTF calculations were performed for fifty-eight (58) data points. Statistical analyses of the dimensionless predicted-to-measured fuel centerline temperature ratios had confirmed the advantage of the new model - the mean value of the predicted-to-measured temperature ratios was increased from 0.8920 to 1.0082 and the standard deviation was decreased from 0.0693 to 0.0382.

We present a methodology based on matrix factorization and gradient descent to predict the number of sessions established in the access points of a Wi-Fi network according to the users' behavior. As the network considered in this work is monitored and controlled by software in order to manage users and resources in real time, we may consider it as a cyber-physical system that interacts with the physical world through access points, whose demands can be predicted according to users' activity. These predictions are useful for relocating or reinforcing some access points according to the changing physical environment. In this work we propose a prediction model based on machine learning techniques, which is validated by comparing the prediction results with real user's activity. Our experiments collected the activity of 1095 users demanding 26,673 network sessions during one month in a Wi-Fi network composed of 10 access points, and the results are qualitatively valid with regard to the previous knowledge. We can conclude that our proposal is suitable for predicting the demand of sessions in access points when some devices are removed taking into account the usual activity of the network users.

The prevalence of pediatric food allergies has increased in children by 50% from 1997 to 2011, affecting 1 in 13 children in the United States. Food allergies can have short- and long-term emotional and physical consequences, which may result in challenges for both children and caregivers. Currently, to our knowledge, there are no low-cost, easily available, evidence-based psychosocial resources for children with food allergies and their families. The Cellie Coping Kit for Food Allergies was created to address this need. This study examined the acceptability and feasibility of the Cellie Coping Kit as an intervention and explored the learning outcomes associated with the kit. Twenty-five children (between ages 7 and 13 with 1 or more food allergies) and their caregivers were recruited from an outpatient clinic while participating in an oral food challenge. Children and caregivers were introduced to the Cellie Coping Kit following their food challenge. Four weeks later, follow-up assessments were completed to evaluate participants' impressions of the intervention. The results suggest that children and caregivers found the Cellie Coping Kit acceptable and feasible. Most (80%-100%) participants thought the intervention materials were trustworthy, found the kit easy to use, liked the appearance of the kit, and would recommend the intervention to others. Approximately 65% of children and 60% of caregivers reported learning from the Cellie Coping Kit. The Cellie Coping Kit for Children with Food Allergies was generally well received by children with food allergies and their families. The Cellie Coping Kit can be used to help facilitate dialog between children and caregivers about food allergy-related issues. While results are promising, additional research (especially in younger children and those newly diagnosed) is needed to determine if the intervention is achieving targeted goals (ie, coping behaviors and improved adherence to medical recommendations).
This paper presents the stability analysis of dc distributed power systems with multiple converter-controlled loads. The load converters are tightly controlled, behaving as constant power loads with low-damped LC filters. The dynamic behavior of the system in high frequency range is often not studied with the classical tools based on conventional averaging techniques. However, dc power systems with the reduced size filter, and consequently, the high resonant frequency, are widely used in transportation applications. In this paper, the stability analysis of the system is established based on a discrete-time model of the system, taking into account the switching frequency and intrinsic nonlinearities of the system model. The impacts of the filter parameters and interactions among the constant power loads are investigated with the proposed discrete-time method. Moreover, an active stabilizer is developed and included in the dynamic model of the system, in order to extend the stability margin. The theoretical observations are then validated experimentally on a laboratory hardware prototype.
Introduction: This article gives an overview of the drug metabolism and disposition (ADME) characteristics of the most common non-rodent species used in toxicity testing of drugs (minipigs, dogs, and monkeys) and compares these to human characteristics with regard to enzymes mediating the metabolism of drugs and the transport proteins which contribute to the absorption, distribution and excretion of drugs. Methods: Literature on ADME and regulatory guidelines of relevance in drug development of small molecules has been gathered. Results: Non-human primates (monkeys) are the species that is closest to humans in terms of genetic homology. Dogs have an advantage due to the ready availability of comprehensive background data for toxicological safety assessment and dogs are easy to handle. Pigs have been used less than dogs and monkeys as a model in safety assessment of drug candidates. However, when a drug candidate is metabolised by aldehyde oxidase (AOX1), N-acetyltransferases (NAT1 and NAT2) or cytochrome (CYP2C9-like) enzymes which are not expressed in dogs, but are present in pigs, this species may be a better choice than dogs, provided that adequate exposure can be obtained in pigs. Conversely, pigsmight not be the right choice if sulfation, involving 3-phosphoadenosyl-5-phosphosulphate sulphotransferase (PAPS) is an important pathway in the human metabolism of a drug candidate. Discussion: In general, the species selection should be based on comparison between in vitro studies with human cell-based systems and animal-cell-based systems. Results from pharmacokinetic studies are also important for decision-making by establishing the obtainable exposure level in the species. Access to genetically humanized mouse models and highly sensitive analytical methods (accelerator mass spectrometry) makes it possible to improve the chance of finding all metabolites relevant for humans before clinical trials have been initiated and, if necessary, to include another animal species before long term toxicity studies are initiated. In conclusion, safety testing can be optimized by applying knowledge about species ADME differences and utilising advanced analytical techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Kolkata City's water supply is dependent on both surface water sources from the river Hooghly and groundwater sources. A large part of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) is currently served by groundwater pumped up from an aquifer deep below the city. The city draws water from the aquifers more rapidly than they can recharge themselves. The adjacent town of Salt Lake City covering an area of 12.35 km(2) was a conglomerate of several salt lakes 50 years back. Though planned as a satellite town, the water level is also decreasing fast due to overuse of groundwater at the rate of 20 cm/year. Therefore the objectives of this study are to find the reason for depletion of the water level, depict the present piezometric level in both Kolkata and Salt Lake City, identify the threat of land subsidence and arsenic contamination already begun in the area and classify the areawise subsidence rate to assume the future threat. The methodology followed in this chapter is mainly the analysis of the secondary data related to the temporal change of groundwater level, counting the land subsidence rate, and so on. The result shows that the city's water level has receded by 7-11 m between 1958 and 2003, especially in some areas of both north and south Kolkata. In around 30 % of the city area the level comes close to or falls below the clay layer which is ideal for subsidence and in some areas subsidence ranges from 10 to 14 mm a year creating high-risk zones. The remedial measures are given in the form of groundwater recharge by rainwater harvesting and mandatory installation of rooftop harvesting in Kolkata and Salt Lake along with improvement of the chemical quality of the water.
Studied the effects of female migrants' acculturation strategies on affective evaluation, sexism and social dominance orientation - SDO in France, as a host country, and Romania, as a home country. The same quasi-experimental design was used in both countries: the description of an integrated, assimilated, separated or marginalized female migrant was introduced to participants and then benevolent and hostile sexism, SDO and the degree of acceptance of the migrant were assessed. A control condition was introduced for assessing these attitudes without migrant description. In France, the female migrant was perceived more positively in the integration condition than in the three other ones while assimilation increased SDO. In Romania, the female migrant was perceived more positively and the benevolent sexism was lower when the home culture was maintained than when it was not. Considering that female migrants strategies depend on the acculturation policies of host countries, these results highlight the role of integration policies for improving female migrants' acceptation, relations between communities and relations between genders. This study contributes to the extant literature through two main innovations: 1/it provides information on the influence of female migrants' acculturation strategies on gender relations and SDO, and 2/it documents this influence in a host and a home country using a similar procedure.
This paper is a reflective exploration of the emotional encounter between social workers and Irish Travellers in child safeguarding cases in the UK, the unconscious defences that may be triggered for social workers, unfamiliar with Travellers, and how these can impact on the relationship and outcomes. It raises concern about how pervasive societal disapproval towards Travellers may be absorbed by social workers, at the expense of a curiosity about historic marginalisation, the contemporary cultural and social context and a recognition of the strengths of the community. Drawing on psychoanalytical insights into race', it comprises a literature review which highlights themes of marginalisation in research on Irish Travellers in the UK. It also includes a narrative interview with a Traveller woman who reflects on the fear that social workers invoke in Travellers, and sets up the key question: what might the emotional state of the social worker be in this scenario.
Purpose - Nonverbal communication comprises a core element of the interactions between leader and follower. Nevertheless, there is limited empirical attention regarding the impact of nonverbal cues on followers' attitudinal outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this gap by linking a salient form of nonverbal communication, kinesics, to an under-researched leader-follower relationship outcome, that is relational identification (RI) with the supervisor. In doing so, the authors also highlight the mediating role of leader-member exchange (LMX) in the aforementioned relationship. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted two studies in different countries. Moreover, the authors examined the hypotheses using hierarchical regression and bootstrap analysis. Findings - As hypothesized, the present results showed that kinesics have both a direct and an indirect effect, through LMX, on RI with the supervisor. Originality/value - To the best of authors' knowledge this is the first study that links a form of nonverbal communication to both LMX and RI.
100 years after Smoluchowski introduced his approach to stochastic processes, they are now at the basis of mathematical and physical modeling in cellular biology: they are used for example to analyse and to extract features from a large number (tens of thousands) of single molecular trajectories or to study the diffusive motion of molecules, proteins or receptors. Stochastic modeling is a new step in large data analysis that serves extracting cell biology concepts. We review here Smoluchowski's approach to stochastic processes and provide several applications for coarse-graining diffusion, studying polymer models for understanding nuclear organization and finally, we discuss the stochastic jump dynamics of telomeres across cell division and stochastic gene regulation.
Cleaning by a horizontal water jet, impinging onto a soiled Perspex vertical plate, is described. The plate, the substrate, was coated with PVA or petroleum jelly, the soil. The substrate was either. (i) fixed, for batch tests in which the cleaned area, roughly circular, grew with time, or (ii) the substrate moved vertically up or down in its own plane, the water jet remaining fixed; this reproduced the effect of a jet moving across a surface for cleaning, as found in real tank cleaning operations. In the batch experiments, growth of the radius a of the cleaning area is well described, at early times t, by a(5) - a(o)(5) = K-5 (t - t(o)), a(o) being the initial radius of the cleaned area at time t(o); K is a constant. At later times with petroleum jelly, the cleaning front reached a maximum value, when the outward momentum of the radially flowing water film balanced the strength of the soil. This maximum value is modelled as a ramp of viscoplastic soil inclined at angle chi to the substrate surface, where chi was found to vary from 7 degrees to 25 degrees. In the tests of continuous cleaning of petroleum jelly, a lengthening cleaned area, of width w(c), was observed on the moving substrate. Near the jet was a stationary clean front, whose shape looked like half an ellipse. This shape, and the width wc, are well described by theory (Wilson et al., 2015, 123, 450-459) using parameters from the above-mentioned batch experiments. This establishes a good link between batch and continuous cleaning experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Background: The determination and regulation of cell morphology are critical components of cell-cycle control, fitness, and development in both single-cell and multicellular organisms. Understanding how environmental factors, chemical perturbations, and genetic differences affect cell morphology requires precise, unbiased, and validated measurements of cell-shape features. Results: Here we introduce two software packages, Morphometrics and BlurLab, that together enable automated, computationally efficient, unbiased identification of cells and morphological features. We applied these tools to bacterial cells because the small size of these cells and the subtlety of certain morphological changes have thus far obscured correlations between bacterial morphology and genotype. We used an online resource of images of the Keio knockout library of nonessential genes in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli to demonstrate that cell width, width variability, and length significantly correlate with each other and with drug treatments, nutrient changes, and environmental conditions. Further, we combined morphological classification of genetic variants with genetic meta-analysis to reveal novel connections among gene function, fitness, and cell morphology, thus suggesting potential functions for unknown genes and differences in modes of action of antibiotics. Conclusions: Morphometrics and BlurLab set the stage for future quantitative studies of bacterial cell shape and intracellular localization. The previously unappreciated connections between morphological parameters measured with these software packages and the cellular environment point toward novel mechanistic connections among physiological perturbations, cell fitness, and growth.
Composite materials, (composites) are engineered or naturally occurring materials made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different properties, which remain, separate and distinct at the macroscopic or microscopic scale even after they are made into a single material. The constituent materials used in it will compensate each other's limitations, so that the resulting material would constitute the advantages of all the included materials. Therefore combining specific materials we would achieve material, which could serve the specific application extensively and so now a days composite materials plays a wide and extensive role in manufacturing engineering components. There are several types of composite materials and methods for manufacturing them. In this paper manufacturing of metal matrix composites by stir casting is taken into focus, manufacturing of Aluminium Alloy (LM6)-SiC particle reinforced MMC by stir casting is the objective. They are widely used in automotive, aeronautical application and so it is given the prime importance. The methodology opted for manufacturing is stir casting because it is the cheapest and easiest and the applications like automotive and aeronautics involves manufacturing and utilization of large number of components, so the price should be low and the process should be easy and simple. Lot of researches is going on this area by varying different parameters. This paper focuses on designing, fabricating and testing different stirrers and feeders and utilizing them in stir casting for the manufacturing of Aluminium silicon carbide composite materials. Then the significance of individual stirrers and feeders are compared and the best one is identified. The significance of each stirrer and feeder is found by testing the specimen.

Palm oil mill effluent (POME), which is rich in organic matter, is one of the major contributors of water pollution. To date, biological treatment has been employed before it is released into water bodies to minimize the environmental hazards. However, the dark brownish colour of the effluent is still a big challenge to be addressed. In regard to this concern, membrane separation can serve as an attractive solution for this issue. This paper aims to investigate the performance of ultrafiltration nanocomposite membrane embedded with coupled zinc-iron oxide (ZIO) for the decolourization of POME. The ZIO was synthesized through the solution combustion technique by employing zinc nitrate hexahydrate and iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate as the precursors and urea as the fuel. The nanocomposite flat sheet membrane was prepared via phase inversion process. The physico-chemical properties of the MMMs were analysed using zeta potential analysis, SEM, BET and contact angle. Continuous filtration test was carried out to evaluate the capability of the MMMs for colour and COD removal. The results showed that the increase in the ZIO loading has drastically increased the membrane surface negativity and led to the colour removal of 70%. In addition, with the addition of M0.5, the permeation and colour removal had increased 25% and 17% respectively, compared to the pristine PVDF membrane. However, the long term filtration test revealed that the structure of M0.5 collapsed after 4 cycles of washing, but M2.0 still retained its performance. In a nutshell, this study demonstrated that negative surface charge has improved the antifouling properties meanwhile hydrophilicity has contributed to increased water flux during the colour removal process.

Public-Key Cryptography (PKC) based on multivariate quadratic equations is one of the most promising alternatives for classical PKC after the eventual coming of quantum computers. Recently, Shen and Tang proposed a new MQ-signature scheme, RGB, based on three types of variables, Red(r), Green(g) and Blue(b). They claimed that signing for RGB is faster than that of UOV and Rainbow. At ACISP 2016, Tang et al. implemented RGB on S5PV210 and MT6582 microprocessors at 64, 80, 96, 118 and 128-bit security levels for practical use. Their results are much more efficient than other MQ-signature schemes, so RGB is very appealing for resource-limited devices. We show that ROB with their suggested parameters at 64, 80, 96, 118 and 128 security levels are entirely broken by key recovery attacks using good keys. From a practical point of view, we are able to break their parameters at 64, 80, 96, 118 and 128 security levels in less than 0.48 seconds, 1.7 seconds, 90.68 seconds, 11 minutes and 6.82 hours, respectively. Consequently, we show that signing and the key sizes for RGB with secure parameter sets are much slower and larger than those of UOV and Rainbow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
A rainwater harvesting system (RHS) was designed for a waste treatment facility located near the town of Mirandela (northern Portugal), to be used in the washing of vehicles and other equipment, the cleaning of outside concrete or asphalt floors, and the watering of green areas. Water tank volumes representing 100% efficiency (V-r) were calculated by the Ripple method with different results depending on two consumption scenarios adopted for irrigation. The RHS design was based on a precipitation record spanning a rather long period (3 decades). The calculated storage capacities fulfilled the water demand even when prolonged droughts occurred during that timeframe. However, because the drought events have been rather scarce the V-r values were considered oversized and replaced by optimal volumes. Notwithstanding the new volumes were solely half of the original V-r values, the projected RHS efficiency remained very high (around 90%) while the probability of system failure (efficiency < 100%) stayed very low (in the order of 5%). In both scenarios, the economic savings related to the optimization of V-r were noteworthy, while the investment's return periods decreased substantially from the original to the optimized solutions. A high efficiency with a low storage capacity is typical of low demanding applications of rainwater harvesting, where water availability (V-w) largely exceeds water demand (C-w), that is to say where demand fractions (C-w/V-w) are very low. Based on the results of a literature review covering an ample geographic distribution and describing a very large number of demand fraction scenarios, a C-w/V-w = 0.8 was defined as the threshold to generally distinguish the low from the high demanding RHS applications.

Aspects of language, such as accent, play a crucial role in the formation and categorization of one's cultural identity. Recent work on accent emphasizes the role of accent in person perception and social categorization, demonstrating that accent also serves as a meaningful indicator of an ethnic category. In this article, we investigate whether the accent of an interaction partner, as a marker for culture, can induce cultural frame-shifts in biculturals. We report the results of three experiments, performed among bicultural and monocultural individuals, in which we test the above hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that accent alone can affect people's cognition.
Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is a reproductive toxicant in male rodents. The aim of the current study was to extrapolate the pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP, a primary metabolite of DEHP) in humans by using data from oral administration of DEHP to chimeric mice transplanted with human hepatocytes. MEHP and its glucuronide were detected in plasma from control mice and chimeric mice after single oral doses of 250 mg DEHP/kg body weight. Biphasic plasma concentration time curves of MEHP and its glucuronide were seen only in control mice. MEHP and its glucuronide were extensively excreted in urine within 24h in mice with humanized liver. In contrast, fecal excretion levels of MEHP glucuronide were high in control mice compared with those with humanized liver. Adjusted animal biomonitoring equivalents from chimeric mice studies were scaled to human biomonitoring equivalents using known species allometric scaling factors and in vitro metabolic clearance data with a simple physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. Estimated urine MEHP concentrations in humans were consistent with reported concentrations. This research illustrates how chimeric mice transplanted with human hepatocytes in combination with a simple PBPK model can assist evaluations of pharmacokinetics or toxicokinetics of the primary or secondary metabolites of DEHP.

Incentivizing development and deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), but also other low carbon technologies (LCT), has been a successful way of promoting new technologies by creating a feasible investment case and making them competitive with traditional energy sources. Although different incentive mechanisms exist, feed-in tariffs have shown to be the best model for accelerating LCT development guaranteeing producers preferential prices for the produced electricity over a period of time and enabling them access to the power network to sell/inject produced electricity. Due to these benefits, feed-in tariff models are the most common model for stimulating RES integration in southeast Europe. The paper reviews the current state of preferential tariffs for RES in countries of southeast Europe. While some countries already have significant installed RES capacity, others are still in the planning stage. The review shows that the amount of installed capacity of a specific technology has a strong impact on the support for the future projects for same technology. This comprehensive review of legislative development supporting RES, as well as technologies preferred in different countries of the region, is supported with feasibility assessment of investing in RES using the example of two different technology projects, wind and photovoltaic, analysing the impact of the current tariffs on the return on investment for each country of the region.
In tropical countries where rainfall rates are high, and especially in deforested areas in the Atlantic Rainforest and Cerrado in southeastern Brazil, water is the dominant driving force of erosion. The most common method used to restore degraded tropical lands is to plant nursery-raised tree seedlings, but this method is not always practical and a variety of newer reforestation techniques have become available. Biodegradable coir geotextiles combined with native seeds can be used to restore degraded forest areas. The effects of the climatic conditions during a seasonal cycle of rain and drought were evaluated on the structural and mechanical properties of coir geotextile fibers that were treated, or not, with lime. Analyses of the tensile strength of coir fibers showed that after 12 months of exposure untreated fiber had retained 23% and treated fiber 19% of their initial strength. Two principal factors were considered in evaluating the structural properties of the coir fibers after environmental exposure: (i) initial cellulose retention and its stability after lime-treatment; (ii) lignin degradation and/or its loss to the environment. The structural changes seen by thermogravimetry (TGA) and Fourier Transforms in Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses explained the changes seen in coir mechanical properties. The greater cellulose contents of fiber structures treated with lime explained their greater tensile strength and high Young's modulus measures after the first three months of exposure in local weather conditions. Considering that lime treatment improved coir fiber properties, lime applications are indicated when coir geotextiles are to be used in acidic Brazilian Cerrado soils.

The Nkx2.5 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in heart development. In humans, heterozygous mutations in NKX2.5 result in congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations cause the disease remain unknown. NKX2.5-R142C is a mutation that was reported to be associated with atrial septal defect (ASD) and atrioventricular (AV) block in 13-patients from one family. The R142C mutation is located within both the DNA-binding domain and the nuclear localization sequence of NKX2.5 protein. The pathogenesis of CHDs in humans with R142C point mutation is not well understood. To examine the functional deficit associated with this mutation in vivo, we generated and characterized a knock-in mouse that harbours the human mutation R142C. Systematic structural and functional examination of the embryonic, newborn, and adult mice revealed that the homozygous embryos Nkx2.5(R141C/R14IC) are developmentally arrested around E10.5 with delayed heart morphogenesis and downregulation of Nkx2.5 target genes, Anf, Mlc2v, Actc1 and Cx40. Histological examination of Nkx(2.5R141c/+) newborn hearts showed that 36% displayed ASD, with at least 80% Of adult heterozygotes displaying a septal defect. Moreover, heterozygous Nkx2.5(R141C/+) newborn mice have downregulation of ion channel genes with 11/12 adult mice manifesting a prolonged PR interval that is indicative of 1st degree AV block. Collectively, the present study demonstrates that mice with the R141C point mutation in the Nkx2.5 allele phenocopies humans with the NKX2.5 R142C point mutation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Deficits in behavioral and cognitive regulation are prevalent in children reared in poverty relative to more affluent children due to the effects of adverse conditions on the developmental underpinnings of these skills. Despite evidence to suggest that these emergent processes are susceptible to environmental inputs, research documenting short-term intervention program influences on these regulatory domains in young impoverished children is limited. We sought to determine the proximal effects of a universal school-based intervention (the PATHS Curriculum) on social, emotional, relational, and cognitive outcomes in urban poor kindergarten children. Four schools in high-poverty neighborhoods with similar demographic characteristics were randomly assigned to either PATHS or an attentional control. Teacher-reported measures of behavior (e.g., attention, concentration, aggression), peer nominations (e.g., likability, aggression, acceptance), and tasks gauging inhibitory control were administered in the fall of kindergarten and again in the spring after one academic year (about 6 months) of PATHS. Children who received PATHS exhibited significantly greater improvements than control students across all teacher-rated behavioral measures of social competence (i.e., emotion regulation, prosocial behavior, peer relations) and behavioral problems (i.e., aggression, internalizing behaviors, impulsivity and hyperactivity) at post-test as well as improvements in motor inhibition. This line of research constitutes an important frontier for prevention research given the implications for improving ultimate outcomes for otherwise disadvantaged children.
Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) form a key link between innate and adaptive immune responses. The aim of this study is to analyze presence and distribution of immature (im) and mature (m) DCs in gingival tissue samples obtained from patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (AgP), chronic periodontitis (CP), and clinically healthy periodontium (control group). Methods: Gingival tissue samples obtained from patients with: 1) AgP (aged= 35 years); and 3) control group (aged >18 years) (n = 10 per group) were collected. Two-way analysis of variance and posterior Fisher least significant difference test were used to observe differences between the means of cells positively marked for imDC (S100, CD1a, and CD207) and mDC (CD208) immunomarkers. Results: imDCs were more numerous in AgP than CP and control groups, being statistically significant only for S100+ cells. Conversely, mDCs were visualized in higher numbers in CP than AgP and control groups (both P <0.05). Considering frequency of immunostained cells, the number of S100+ cells was greater than CD207+ and CD1a+ cells, followed by a lesser number of CD208+ cells, in all groups. Conclusions: Considering that the ability of DCs to regulate immunity is dependent on DC maturation, results suggest that predominance of imDCs appears to be involved in AgP pathogenesis, probably due to lack of ability to induce immune cell activation. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of DC maturation in regulating immune responses in periodontal disease.
The purpose of this study was to determine the environmental impacts associated with a deep energy efficiency refurbishment using life cycle assessment. A prototypical refurbished model of an office building located in Auckland, New Zealand was used as a case study. The refurbishment included major changes to the building envelope with additional insulation, modified wall-window ratio, solar shading as well as technical replacement of the lighting and HVAC system. The study included identification of environmental hot spots of a deep energy refurbishment, and consideration of the effect of different electricity mixes in New Zealand on the total environmental impact of the refurbished building when compared to the un-refurbished existing building over different operation periods. An environmental payback period was calculated for each impact category. The results of this study indicate that deep energy refurbishment is associated with significant environmental impacts mainly due to the use of energy-intensive construction materials. However, the refurbishment yields net reductions in most impact categories if the building has a longer operational period. The environmental impacts of a building's operation are mainly associated New Zealand's electricity generated from coal. As future scenarios of New Zealand's electricity mix have a reduced share of electricity generated from coal, the environmental benefits of avoided electricity consumption are also reduced. The study concludes that measures to promote energy efficiency refurbishment in office buildings where a significant proportion of the operational energy is provided from renewable energy sources, should be carefully considered because they may not reduce overall environmental impacts.

Human brain asymmetries have been well described. Intriguingly, a number of asymmetries in brain phenotypes have been shown to change throughout the lifespan. Recent studies have revealed topological asymmetries between hemispheric white matter networks in the human brain. However, it remains unknown whether and how these topological asymmetries evolve from adolescence to young adulthood, a critical period that constitutes the second peak of human brain and cognitive development. To address this question, the present study included a large cohort of healthy adolescents and young adults. Diffusion and structural magnetic resonance imaging were acquired to construct hemispheric white matter networks, and graph-theory was applied to quantify topological parameters of the hemispheric networks. In both adolescents and young adults, rightward asymmetry in both global and local network efficiencies was consistently observed between the 2 hemispheres, but the degree of the asymmetry was significantly decreased in young adults. At the nodal level, the young adults exhibited less rightward asymmetry of nodal efficiency mainly around the parasylvian area, posterior tempo-parietal cortex, and fusiform gyrus. These developmental patterns of network asymmetry provide novel insight into the human brain structural development from adolescence to young adulthood and also likely relate to the maturation of language and social cognition that takes place during this period.
This paper focuses on learning a smooth skeleton structure from noisy data-an emerging topic in the fields of computer vision and computational biology. Many dimensionality reduction methods have been proposed, but none are specially designed for this purpose. To achieve this goal, we propose a unified probabilistic framework that directly models the posterior distribution of data points in an embedding space so as to suppress data noise and reveal the smooth skeleton structure. Within the proposed framework, a sparse positive similarity matrix is obtained by solving a box-constrained convex optimization problem, in which the sparsity of the matrix represents the learned neighborhood graph and the positive weights stand for the new similarity. Embedded data points are then obtained by applying the maximum a posteriori estimation to the posterior distribution expressed by the learned similarity matrix. The embedding process naturally provides a probabilistic interpretation of Laplacian eigenmap and maximum variance unfolding. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our proposed method obtains the embedded points that accurately uncover inherent smooth skeleton structures in terms of data visualization, and the method yields superior clustering performance compared to various baselines.
End-to-end learning machines enable a direct mapping from the raw input data to the desired outputs, eliminating the need for hand-crafted features. Despite less engineering effort than the hand-crafted counterparts, these learning machines achieve extremely good results for many computer vision and medical image analysis tasks. Two dominant classes of end-to-end learning machines are massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although MTANNs have been actively used for a number of medical image analysis tasks over the past two decades, CNNs have recently gained popularity in the field of medical imaging. In this study, we have compared these two successful learning machines both experimentally and theoretically. For that purpose, we considered two well-studied topics in the field of medical image analysis: detection of lung nodules and distinction between benign and malignant lung nodules in computed tomography (CT). For a thorough analysis, we used 2 optimized MTANN architectures and 4 distinct CNN architectures that have different depths. Our experiments demonstrated that the performance of MTANNs was substantially higher than that of CNN when using only limited training data. With a larger training dataset, the performance gap became less evident even though the margin was still significant. Specifically, for nodule detection, MTANNs generated 2.7 false positives per patient at 100% sensitivity, which was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the best performing CNN model with 22.7 false positives per patient at the same level of sensitivity. For nodule classification, MTANNs yielded an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8806 (95% CI: 0.8389-0.9223), which was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the best performing CNN model with an AUC of 0.7755 (95% CI: 0.7120-0.8270). Thus, with limited training data, MTANNs would be a suitable end-to-end machine-learning model for detection and classification of focal lesions that do not require high-level semantic features.
In this work an ultrasound-based measurement method is used for monitoring suspension velocity and build-up of magnetic material inside a wet low-intensity magnetic separator, a process used e.g. in beneficiation of magnetite ores. Today the only available option is to monitor material transport between unit operations; i.e. flow rate, solids concentration, and particle size distribution of suspension flow in pipes are measured online using standard equipment. An acoustic backscatter system is fitted to the tank of a separator, and used to monitor the internal flow. A method called ultrasonic velocity profiling is used to capture internal velocity profiles. Simultaneously, the backscatter signal intensity is used to get indications about local solids concentration of the flow, and build-up of magnetic material. The methods are evaluated in realistic conditions, where the effect of varying factors relevant to machine performance is investigated. The included factors are; the slurry feed rate, the slurry solids concentration, the magnet assembly angle, and the drum rotational speed. The presented method gives useful information about the internal material flow inside the separator. The velocity measurements capture the, sometimes complex, internal flow patterns, for example the presence and velocity of a recirculating flow in the dewatering zone. Additionally, keeping a balanced material loading in the concentrate dewatering zone is important to separator performance. Using the signal backscatter intensity it is possible to qualitatively monitor this material loading. Generally these direct measurements can aid in improvements to machine design, process optimization, and process control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
In this letter, we propose a change detection method based on Gabor wavelet features for very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, Gabor wavelet features are extracted from two temporal VHR images to obtain spatial and contextual information. Then, the Gabor-waveletbased difference measure (GWDM) is designed to generate the difference image. In GWDM, a new local similarity measure is defined, in which the Markov random field neighborhood system is incorporated to obtain a local relationship, and the coefficient of variation method is applied to discriminate contributions from different features. Finally, the fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm is employed to obtain the final change map. Experiments employing QuickBird and SPOT5 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting (RFRH) system collecting runoff by the plastic mulched ridges is a useful method to improve crop productivity in northwest China. We performed a field study where the RFRH system was combined with irrigation (RI) to reduce water irrigation use and to increase the crop water use efficiency (WUE) in a semi-humid climate. The amount of irrigation using RI was reduced by half compared with traditional furrow irrigation (FI) and border irrigation (BI) due to its rainwater harvesting effects. Our results showed that the RI treatment effectively alleviated drought stress during key periods of crop growth. At the jointing stage, the soil water storage in the 0-200 cm soil layer was increased by 2.82-8.02% and 2.25-8.40% compared with Fl and BI, respectively, and the soil water consumption by maize below 60 cm was significantly decreased at the tasselling stage. With RI, the harvest biomass, grain yield, and WUE were significantly increased by 14.59-19.93%, 5.33-7.01%, and 12.21-18.01% compared with Fl, respectively, and compared with BI, these values were significantly increased by 24.48-27.25%, 8.83-11.23%, and 14.99-22.91%, respectively. The irrigation amount was reduced by 1500 m(3) hm(-2), and the irrigation WUE with RI was 2.1 and 2.2 times higher than that using Fl and BI. The irrigation water productivity was improved by 1.71 and 5.70 times compared with Fl and BI, respectively in 2011. These results suggest that combining the RFRH system with irrigation is suitable for reducing irrigation water use by enhancing the efficient utilization of local rainfall, which could have very important applications in irrigated fields in semi-humid or semi-arid areas.

Nowadays elders, often find it difficult to keep track of their cognitive and functional abilities required for remaining independent in their homes. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) are the Ambient Intelligence based technologies for the support of daily activities to elders. Traditional rehabilitation is an example of a common activity elders may require and that usually implies they move to the rehabilitation clinics, which is the main reason for treatment discontinuation. Tele-rehabilitation is a solution that not only may help elders but also their family members and health professionals to monitor elder's treatment. The purpose of this paper is to present a tele-rehabilitation system that uses the motion-tracking sensor of the Kinect, to allow the elderly users natural interaction, combined with a set of external sensors as a form of input. Data fusion techniques are applied in order to integrate these data for detecting right movements and to monitor elder's treatment in the rehabilitation process.
We derive the John-Sclavounos equations, describing the motion of a fluid particle on the sea surface, from first principles using Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms applied to the motion of a frictionless particle constrained on an unsteady surface. This framework leads to a number of new insights into the particle kinematics. The main result is that vorticity generated on a stress-free surface vanishes at a wave crest when the horizontal particle velocity equals the crest propagation speed, which is the kinematic criterion for wave breaking. If this holds for the largest crest, then the symplectic two-form associated with the Hamiltonian dynamics reduces instantaneously to that associated with the motion of a particle in free flight, as if the surface did not exist. Further, exploiting the conservation of the Hamiltonian function for steady surfaces and travelling waves, we show that particle velocities remain bounded at all times, ruling out the possibility of the finite-time blowup of solutions.
This paper focuses on dynamic modeling, simulation and control of Advanced Automatic Pumping Station with Canal Level Remote Control System using ABB PLC (Programmable Logical Controller) based Fuzzy Logic Controller. The system is designed for the agricultural land where the water level (i.e. canals or rivers) is low and traditional system of irrigation is not working well. System is automated through two different controllers, first controller automate the water reservoir gate according to the upper and lower limits of reservoir level and second controller dealt with speed of two pumps with respect to the set point of water level in canal. For controlling, monitoring and real time visualization of a system, HMI (Humane Interface Machine -CP 405) is connected. The applied control method is based on Fuzzy Logic System, designed in MATLAB Simulink, which can communicate with PLC through OPC server by using gateway. Through GPRS based system communication is done between PLC and canal water level meter. A digital control unit PLC (AC500 PM556-ETH) gets data from the system, take the require actions and make decision to operate the pumping station. Simulation results show that system can effectively operate in both, automatic as well as manual conditions depending on selection switch.
The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the auxiliary effects that the application of three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D-CAD) had on students' creative design, and the differences in the effects of 3D-CAD on students with different representational abilities (RAs). An unequal-group pretest-posttest quasi-experiment design was developed to analyze 215 students studying in an anonymous senior high school in Taipei City, Taiwan. The findings of the present study were as follows: 1. The students' RAs achieved a moderate and positive correlation with their creative performance (CP), with increased correlation between RAs and the functionality and expressiveness constructs of CP and CP with the iconic representation (IR) construct of RAs. 2. 3D-CAD evidently improved the students' CP, particularly their expressiveness and functionality. 3. During 3D-CAD intervention, the students with low RAs performed similarly to those with high RAs in terms of novelty and expressiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
The purpose of this research is to use the protection motivation theory to examine base-of-the pyramid (BoP) consumers' environmentally friendly behaviors. BoP consumers suffer from the threat of environmental degradation and resource scarcity, particularly in emerging economies. They have not benefited from worldwide economic development as much as their counterparts in the middle and affluent classes. Based on the protection motivation theory, we investigate how threat appraisal and coping appraisal affect BoP consumers' intentions to engage in pro-environmental household behaviors. The proposed relationships are tested using self-reported data of Chinese BoP consumers. The results indicate that these threat and coping appraisal variables are related to BoP consumers' low-cost and/or high-cost household green behaviors. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
INTRODUCTION: Advanced air-flow limitation in patients with COPD leads to a reduction in vital capacity, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. However, its impact on chest and abdominal wall mobility is unknown. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of patients with COPD with reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility and to investigate the effect of reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity. METHODS: In 51 elderly male subjects with COPD, chest and abdominal wall mobility, FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, maximal inspiratory pressure (P-Imax), maximal expiratory pressure (P-Emax), and the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) were assessed. Chest and abdominal wall mobility were measured using the breathing movement scale (0-8) at the 3 regions (upper chest, lower chest, and abdomen). Reduced mobility was defined as a value lower than the lower limit of the normal scale. The unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney test, and multiple regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: The percentages of subjects with reduced mobility were 78% for the upper chest, 76% for the lower chest, and 53% for the abdomen. The subjects with reduced mobility had significantly low FVC, FEV1, and 6MWD in each region and significantly low FEV1/FVC, PImax, and PEmax in the abdominal region compared with those with nonreduced mobility. FVC and 6MWD were independently associated with the scale values in each region and with the abdominal scale value, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of subjects with COPD had reduced chest and abdominal wall mobility, which was independently associated with FVC. Even though abdominal wall mobility was relatively preserved compared with chest wall mobility, it was also independently associated with 6MWD.
In this study we provide a computerized graph structure for synthesizing and displaying the data on a region's ecosystem-economic system. By applying Mathematica-based graph modeling we create a causal network of the synergistic impact mechanism among certain climate related factors. Our computational approach identifies a climate factor that affects most immediately or most strongly the others. Important factors are indicated through the use of graph theoretical tools. Our graph-based approach and its computational aspects allow for factor ranking(s) according to their importance to the network both numerically and visually, for certain settlement types. Our contribution provides quantitative estimates of impacts and adaptation potentials of five potential effects of climate change ( migration, flooding-landslides-fire, air and water pollution, human health and energy-water-other resources) which play a substantial role at the synergistic impact mechanism. By using graph visualization techniques, the structure of the synergistic impact mechanism is selfevident. Specifically, graph layouts are created to detect i) the causal relationships of the synergistic mechanism under study ii) the most influential factor(s) in the synergistic mechanism and iii) classify the factor's roles (based on the degree of their impact) within the coping mechanism. Highlighting graph elements let information for policy implications stand out. (C) 2017 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved
Introduction: Restoration of native head-shaft angle (HSA) is critical for treatment of proximal humerus fracture. However, HSA has not been properly investigated according to the humeral rotation. This study was designed to analyze the relationship between the humeral rotation and the HSA at 1 increments, and clarify its serial changing pattern according to the humeral rotation. Hypothesis: The angulation of HSA would be undervalued when the humerus is being rotated externally and it would be overvalued when it is being rotated internally. Materials and methods: Eight dried cadaveric normal humeri were CT scanned. They were analyzed using computer-aided design with a standardized neutral position. HSA was the angle between the humeral shaft axis (SA) and the humeral head axis (HA). SA and HA were the best-fit lines through center of all the best-fitting circles in every cross section along the humeral shaft and within the humeral head, respectively. Each 3D model was rotated 30 degrees internally and 45 degrees externally relatives to the SA at 1 degrees increments with the camera was fixed at antero-posterior view of neutral position. Angulation of HSA in every rotational degree was documented as ratio relatives to the angulation of HSA in neutral position. Results: The average HSA at neutral position was 133 +/- 1.93 degrees HSA was underestimated by 8 +/- 1.9% and it was overestimated by 20 +/- 5.1% at the maximum external rotation (ER) and internal rotation (IR), respectively. HSA was underestimated by 1% in every 5.8 degrees of ER and overestimated by 1% in every 1.5 degrees of IR. Rotational misalignments within 10 degrees of IR and 18 degrees of ER could be tolerated (P >.05). Conclusions: HSA was underestimated at ER and was overestimated at IR. This information could be useful for surgeons in restoring the native HSA for treatment of proximal humerus fracture.
Criminal (drug and prostitution) charges, employment levels (weekly hours), recent substance use in the past 6 months, and primary sources of income were examined among a sample (n = 106) of women ex-offenders who had opioid use disorders with and without methadone histories. A general linear model was tested to examine differences in relation to methadone use history. Results from a one-way MANCOVA found that those with methadone histories reported significantly higher levels of drug and prostitution charges than those without any methadone history, but no significant differences in terms of weekly hours of employment or recent substance use were observed between groups. Women ex-offenders with methadone histories reported various sources of income beyond employment, and proportionally, more of these women reported prostitution as a primary source of income. Findings suggest that methadone maintenance treatments are not sufficient in meeting the needs of women ex-offenders.
In recent work, Baez, Fong and the author introduced a framework for describing Markov processes equipped with a detailed balanced equilibrium as open systems of a certain type. These open Markov processes serve as the building blocks for more complicated processes. In this paper, we describe the potential application of this framework in the modeling of biological systems as open systems maintained away from equilibrium. We show that non-equilibrium steady states emerge in open systems of this type, even when the rates of the underlying process are such that a detailed balanced equilibrium is permitted. It is shown that these non-equilibrium steady states minimize a quadratic form which we call dissipation. In some circumstances, the dissipation is approximately equal to the rate of change of relative entropy plus a correction term. On the other hand, Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production generally fails for non-equilibrium steady states. We use a simple model of membrane transport to illustrate these concepts.
Quantitative genetics theory predicts adaptive evolution to be constrained along evolutionary lines of least resistance. In theory, hybridization and subsequent interspecific gene flow may, however, rapidly change the evolutionary constraints of a population and eventually change its evolutionary potential, but empirical evidence is still scarce. Using closely related species pairs of Lake Victoria cichlids sampled from four different islands with different levels of interspecific gene flow, we tested for potential effects of introgressive hybridization on phenotypic evolution in wild populations. We found that these effects differed among our study species. Constraints measured as the eccentricity of phenotypic variance-covariance matrices declined significantly with increasing gene flow in the less abundant species for matrices that have a diverged line of least resistance. In contrast, we find no such decline for the more abundant species. Overall our results suggest that hybridization can change the underlying phenotypic variance-covariance matrix, potentially increasing the adaptive potential of such populations.
