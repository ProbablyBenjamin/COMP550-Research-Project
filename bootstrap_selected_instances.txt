Context awareness and activity recognition are becoming a hot research topic in ambient intelligence (AmI) and ubiquitous robotics, due to the latest advances in wireless sensor network research which provides a richer set of context data and allows a wide coverage of AmI environments. However, using raw sensor data for activity recognition is subject to different constraints and makes activity recognition inaccurate and uncertain. The Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, known as belief functions, gives a convenient mathematical framework to handle uncertainty issues in sensor information fusion and facilitates decision making for the activity recognition process. Dempster-Shafer theory is more and more applied to represent and manipulate contextual information under uncertainty in a wide range of activity-aware systems. However, using this theory needs to solve the mapping issue of sensor data into high-level activity knowledge. The present paper contributes new ways to apply the Dempster-Shafer theory using binary discrete sensor information for activity recognition under uncertainty. We propose an efficient mapping technique that allows converting and aggregating the raw data captured, using a wireless senor network, into high-level activity knowledge. In addition, we propose a conflict resolution technique to optimize decision making in the presence of conflicting activities. For the validation of our approach, we have used a real dataset captured using sensors deployed in a smart home. Our results demonstrate that the improvement of activity recognition provided by our approaches is up to of 79 %. These results demonstrate also that the accuracy of activity recognition using the Dempster-Shafer theory with the proposed mappings outperforms both na < ve Bayes classifier and J48 decision tree.
This paper addresses dynamical behaviors of switching van der Pol circuits by investigating stability issues of autonomous nonlinear dynamical systems. Firstly, a kind of nonlinear dynamical systems, i.e., a piecewise/ switching autonomous nonlinear system, is used to formulate a class of van der Pol circuits that are composed of at least two alternative electrical sub-circuits. Secondly, based on the concept of system stability in the sense of Lyapunov and continuously positive definite functions, this paper proposes two new necessary and sufficient conditions of stability/ asymptotic stability for autonomous nonlinear systems. Thirdly, based on the new stability results obtained in this paper, we present several criteria for globally asymptotical stability and local instability of the unique zero equilibrium of such kind of electrical circuits. Meanwhile, the existence and uniqueness of a stable limit cycle are also given for the switching van der Pol circuit. These novel results obtained in this paper show that switching actions involved in van der Pol circuits may vanish the classical nonlinear dynamical phenomena of relaxation oscillations. Finally, numerical simulations of several nonlinear systems and a switching van der Pol circuit illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our new results.
The purpose of this work is twofold. First, it aims to analyze the teaching and learning processes applied to degrees that enable regulated professional activities for both Technical Industrial Engineering and Industrial Engineering. More precisely, it examines the competences related to Manufacturing Engineering, either at the Bachelor's or Master's Level. Second, it intends to establish a simple and easy process to evaluate the competences acquired in a certain Bachelor's or Master's degree. As a result, it will be possible to identify current weaknesses in the study plans. This could be the universities' starting point in the definition of procedures and areas for improvement that allow for a better match among study plans, the acquisition of competences, and the learning results finally achieved.

Rapid vehicle and powertrain development has become essential to for the design and implementation of vehicles that meet and exceed the fuel efficiency, cost, and performance targets expected by today's consumer while keeping pace with reduced development cycle and More frequent product releases. Recently, advances in large-scale additive manufacturing have provided the means to bridge hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimentation and preproduction mule chassis evaluation. This paper details the accelerated development of a printed range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, by paralleling hardware-in-the-loop development of the powertrain with rapid chassis prototyping using big area additive manufacturing (BAAM). BAAM's ability to accelerate the mule vehicle development from computer-aided design to vehicle build is explored. The use of a hardware-in the-loop laboratory is described as it is applied to the design of a range-extended electric powertrain to be installed in a printed prototype vehicle. The integration of the powertrain and the opportunities and challenges it presents are described in this work. A comparison of offline simulation, HIL and chassis rolls results is presented to validate the development process. Chassis dynamometer results for battery electric and range extender operation are analyzed to show the benefits of the architecture. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

BackgroundTwo important influences on students' evaluations of teaching are relationship and professor effects. Relationship effects reflect unique matches between students and professors such that some professors are unusually effective for some students, but not for others. Professor effects reflect inter-rater agreement that some professors are more effective than others, on average across students. AimsWe attempted to forecast students' evaluations of live lectures from brief, video-recorded teaching trailers. SampleParticipants were 145 college students (74% female) enrolled in introductory psychology courses at a public university in the Great Lakes region of the United States. MethodsStudents viewed trailers early in the semester and attended live lectures months later. Because subgroups of students viewed the same professors, statistical analyses could isolate professor and relationship effects. ResultsEvaluations were influenced strongly by relationship and professor effects, and students' evaluations of live lectures could be forecasted from students' evaluations of teaching trailers. That is, we could forecast the individual students who would respond unusually well to a specific professor (relationship effects). We could also forecast which professors elicited better evaluations in live lectures, on average across students (professor effects). Professors who elicited unusually good evaluations in some students also elicited better memory for lectures in those students. ConclusionsIt appears possible to forecast relationship and professor effects on teaching evaluations by presenting brief teaching trailers to students. Thus, it might be possible to develop online recommender systems to help match students and professors so that unusually effective teaching emerges.
Using Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS), we demonstrated in four experiments that affective information extracted from unseen faces influences both affective and personality judgments of neutral faces. In four experiments, participants judged neutral faces as more pleasant or unpleasant (Studies 1 and 2) or as more or less trustworthy, likable, and attractive (Study 3) or as more or less competent or interpersonally warm (Study 4) when paired with unseen smiling or scowling faces compared to when paired with unseen neutral faces. These findings suggest that affective influences are a normal part of everyday experience and provide evidence for the affective foundations consciousness. Affective misattribution arises even when affective changes occur after a neutral stimulus is presented, demonstrating that these affective influences cannot be explained as a simple semantic priming effect. These findings have implications for understanding the constructive nature of experience, as well as the role of affect in social impressions.
The Thermal hydraulics, Aerosols and Iodine (ThAI) facility, located in Eschborn, Germany, is a 60-m(3) steel test vessel designed to simulate operational and accident conditions in a nuclear containment structure. The ThAI facility provides experimental data used for validation of thermal-hydraulic codes. The test performed at this facility has been modeled using the GOTHIC 8.1(QA) software package for the purpose of validating both physical models and modeling techniques. The test analyzed is from step 2 of the International Standard Problem 47 test performed at the ThAI facility. This test consisted of three injection ports for steam and helium to enter the vessel off-axis. The off-axis injection locations along with the compartmented geometry of the facility provide a complex coupling of physics that would be present in an accident transient inside the containment of a typical light water reactor. Key considerations of this analysis are stratification of the steam and helium, condensation deposition, and flow patterns within the vessel.
In this study, large-size direct shear tests were conducted to determine the interfacial shear characteristics of sand geotextile under three different normal stresses. The geotextiles used in the present study were hybrid needlepunched nonwovens containing defined weight proportions of jute and polypropylene fibers. Subsequently, the interfacial shear characteristics of hybrid and that of a nonwoven geotextile consisting of solely polypropylene fibers with sand were compared and analyzed under different normal stresses. Initial higher shear stiffness of sand-polypropylene geotextiles was observed corresponding to sand-hybrid geotextiles specifically under higher normal stresses. Nevertheless, the contact efficiency of sand-hybrid nonwovens was similar to that of sand-polypropylene geotextiles. The surface morphology of sand particles has been investigated based on the images obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and quantitatively analyzed by means of Wadell roundness and degree of angularity methods.

Although person perception is central to virtually all human social behavior, it is ordinarily studied in isolated individual perceivers. Conceptualizing it as a socially distributed process opens up a variety of novel issues, which have been addressed in scattered literatures mostly outside of social psychology. This article examines some of these issues using a series of multiagent models. Perceivers can use gossip (information from others about social targets) to improve their ability to detect targets who perform rare negative behaviors. The model suggests that they can simultaneously protect themselves against being influenced by malicious gossip intended to defame specific targets. They can balance these potentially conflicting goals by using specific strategies including disregarding gossip that differs from a personally obtained impression. Multiagent modeling demonstrates the outcomes produced by different combinations of assumptions about gossip, and suggests directions for further research and theoretical development.
The mechanism of tacrine as a precognitive drug has been considered to be complex and not fully understood. It has been reported to involve a wide spectrum of targets involving cholinergic, gabaergic, nitrinergic and glutamatergic pathways. Here, we review the effect of tacrine and its derivatives on the NMDA receptors (NMDAR) with a focus on the mechanism of action and biological consequences related to the Alzheimer's disease treatment. Our findings indicate that effect of tacrine on glutamatergic neurons is both direct and indirect. Direct NMDAR antagonistic effect is often reported by in vitro studies; however, it is achieved by high tacrine concentrations which are not likely to occur under clinical conditions. The impact on memory and behavioral testing can be ascribed to indirect effects of tacrine caused by influencing the NMDAR-mediated currents via Ml receptor activation, which leads to inhibition of Ca2+-activated potassium channels. Such inhibition prevents membrane re polarization leading to prolonged NMDAR activation and subsequently to long term potentiation. Considering these findings, we can conclude that tacrine-derivatives with dual cholinesterase and NMDARs modulating activity may represent a promising approach in the drug development for diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction, such as the Alzheimer disease.
